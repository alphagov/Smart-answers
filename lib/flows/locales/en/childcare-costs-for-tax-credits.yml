      body: |
        You can claim extra tax credits to [help with your childcare costs](/childcare-tax-credits "Childcare and tax credits") if you’re eligible. Use this tool to work out what childcare costs you should claim. 

        If you already claim tax credits for childcare costs and your costs have changed, you can use this tool to work out if you need to report the change to the Tax Credit Office.

          Sometimes you may pay - or expect to pay - different amounts for childcare (known as ‘variable costs’), for example:

          + you regularly use childcare, but pay more during school holidays than you do at term time
          + the hours you use childcare change from week to week or month to month

          ##How to work out your childcare costs

          Add up how much you have spent in total over the last 12 months - start backwards from the date you’re doing the calculation.
