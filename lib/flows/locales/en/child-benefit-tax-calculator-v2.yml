        title: You don’t need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge.

          This is an estimate based on the income figures you provided.

          The result may be different if your income changes during the tax year.

        title: The person with the highest income will have to pay £%{benefit_tax}.

          Child Benefit | Your results

          Child Benefit you get for the tax year | £%{benefit_claimed_amount}
          Child Benefit that's counted when working out the tax to pay | £%{benefit_taxable_amount}
          Percentage of Child Benefit you must pay as tax | %{percentage_tax_charge}%

          This is an estimate based on the income figures you provided. If your income changes during the tax year, use the calculator to get a new estimate.

          You can either:

          - carry on getting Child Benefit and whoever has the highest income pays £%{benefit_tax} through the [Self Assessment system](/self-assessment-tax-returns "Self Assessment tax returns") - they must [register for Self Assessment](/register-for-self-assessment "register for Self Assessment") if they haven’t already and [declare Child Benefit payments](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childbenefitcharge/declaringchildbenefit "Declaring Child Benefit payments"){:rel="external"} on their tax return
          - ask for [Child Benefit payments to be stopped](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stopchbpayments "Stop Child Benefit payments"){:rel="external"} (only the person getting Child Benefit can do this) - the tax charge will be owed on any Child Benefit paid for weeks after 7 January 2013

          ^ If you decide to stop your Child Benefit payments, you will still get [National Insurance credits](/boost-state-pension "Boost your State pension") for as long as you’re entitled to claim Child Benefit. You can also apply for Child Benefit but ask for it not to be paid to you. ^
