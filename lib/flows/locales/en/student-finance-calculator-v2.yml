        description: Student finance calculator - get a quick estimate of what student loans, grants, bursaries and other funding you could get - for full-time, part-time and EU students
      title: Student finance calculator
      body: |
        This calculator is for students from England starting their course on or after **1 September 2012**.

        Use the student finance calculator to estimate:

        + student loans
        + student grants
        + extra student funding - eg if you’re disabled or have children

        Your result will be more accurate if you know your annual household income (your parents’ or partner’s income plus your own).
