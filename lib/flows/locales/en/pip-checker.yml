          ##After they turn 16

          Most children won't be affected by Personal Independence Payment (PIP) until 2015, but there are some exceptions.

          They'll be asked to make a claim for PIP if after October 2013 their:

          * health condition or disability changes
          * Disability Living Allowance award is due to end and they haven't received a renewal letter

          Unless either of these happen – you don't need to do anything. You'll get a letter in 2015 explaining:

          * what will happen to their DLA
          * how they can claim Personal Independence Payment

          You don't have to do anything now.

          * what will happen to their DLA

          Because you'll be 65 or over on 8 April 2013, you can continue to get [Disability Living Allowance](/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit "Disability Living Allowance") for as long as you're eligible.
