        Embassies can help if:

        - you or someone you know has been arrested or hospitalised
        - you need to get in touch with relatives (eg if you’ve run out of money or there’s an emergency)
        - there’s a crisis in the country you’re in

        ^The embassy won’t be able to give you money or help you financially.^

        They can also provide consular services like:

        - registering a birth, marriage or death that happened abroad
        - providing copies of certificates for marriages, births or deaths registered abroad
        - certifying documents (like a passport or birth certificate)
        - witnessing a signature or affidavit
