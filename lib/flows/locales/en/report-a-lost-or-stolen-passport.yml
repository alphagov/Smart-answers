          - [fill in from LS01 online](https://passports.ips.gov.uk/lsrr1a/index.aspx?c=1 "LS01 form") - the Identity and Passport Service will post you a completed form to sign and return
          - [download a copy](http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@travel/documents/digitalasset/dg_175799.pdf "Download LS01"){:rel="external"} of form LS01 and post the completed form to the IPS - the address is on the form

          ##Replacing your passport

          You can apply for a replacement at the same time if you’re a British national and in the UK.

          Follow the same process as [renewing a passport](/renew-adult-passport "Renew your adult passport"), but you:


          - must send a completed form LS01 with your application (if you’ve haven’t already reported it as lost)
          - must get your application countersigned
          - may be interviewed by the IPS to prove your identity
          - may be asked for original supporting documents (eg birth or marriage certificates) when the IPS gets your application

          % You can’t use the [1-day Premium service](/get-a-passport-urgently "Get a passport urgently") if you’re replacing a lost passport. % 

          ##If you find your passport

          If you find your passport, don’t sign the form. Instead, return the form in the envelope provided with a signed note confirming that you have found your passport and don’t want to cancel it.
