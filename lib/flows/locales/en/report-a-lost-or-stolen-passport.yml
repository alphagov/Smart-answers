          ##Replacing your passport

          You can apply for a replacement at the same time if you’re a British national and in the UK.

          Follow the same process as [renewing a passport](/renew-adult-passport "Renew your adult passport"), but you:


          - must send a completed form LS01 with your application (if you’ve haven’t already reported it as lost)
          - must get your application countersigned
          - may be interviewed by the IPS to prove your identity
          - may be asked for original supporting documents (eg birth or marriage certificates) when the IPS gets your application

          % You can’t use the [1-day Premium service](/get-a-passport-urgently "Get a passport urgently") if you’re replacing a lost passport. % 

          ##If you find your passport

          If you find your passport, don’t sign the form. Instead, return the form in the envelope provided with a signed note confirming that you have found your passport and don’t want to cancel it.
