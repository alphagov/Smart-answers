        Calculate Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for your employee.

        ##What you need to know

        You’re only responsible for paying SSP if:

        - you pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions for your employee (or would do if not for their age or their level of earnings)
        - you don’t provide your own occupational sick pay scheme
        - your employee was sick for 4 or more days in a row (including non-working days)
        - your employee has told you they’re sick within your own time limit (or 7 days if you don’t have one)

        ^ You can’t use the calculator for periods of sickness before 6 April 2011.^

      # Answer 1
      already_getting_maternity:
        body: |
          Your employee isn’t entitled to statutory sick pay because they’re already receiving Statutory Maternity Pay or Maternity Allowance.

      # Answer 2
      must_be_sick_for_4_days:
        body: |
          Your employee must be sick for at least 4 days in a row to get Statutory Sick Pay.

      # Answer 3
      didnt_tell_soon_enough:
        body: |
          Your employee isn’t entitled to statutory sick pay because they didn’t tell you they were sick soon enough.

          You must send them form SSP1 no more than 7 days after they’ve told you they’re sick. They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance "Benefits & credits: employment support allowance (ESA)").

      # Answer 4
      not_regular_schedule:

          If your employee has an irregular work schedule, you’ll need to work out Statutory Sick Pay manually. See pages 1 to 6 in HMRC’s ‘Employer Helpbook for Statutory Sick Pay.’

      # Answer 5
      not_earned_enough:
        body: |
          Your employee isn’t entitled to statutory sick pay because they haven’t earned enough to qualify.

          You must send them form SSP1 no more than 7 days after they’ve told you they’re sick. They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance "Benefits & credits: employment support allowance (ESA)").

      # Answer 6
      entitled_to_sick_pay:
        body: |
          %{paternity_adoption_warning}

          Your employee is entitled to sick pay:

          - %{ssp_payment} in total
          - for %{days_paid} out of %{normal_workdays_out} taken off sick between %{sick_start_date} and %{sick_end_date}

            The first 3 days of any period of illness (or any linked periods of illness separated by less than 8 weeks) won’t be paid. The payment amount will reflect this.


          SSP can be paid for up to 28 weeks of an employee’s normal workdays. For this employee that equals a total of %{pattern_days_total} days. After that you must give them form SSP1 within 7 days of SSP ending. They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA).](/employment-support-allowance "Benefits & credits: employment support allowance (ESA)")

          There are also [records you must keep](/sick-leave-pay-employees/entitlement "Sick pay for your employees: Entitlement") and rules on [proof of illness](/sick-leave-pay-employees/notice-and-fit-notes "Sick pay for your employee’s: notice and fit notes") you can ask for.

            You may be able to [recover the statutory payments](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/employees/statutory-pay/ssp-calc.htm "How to calculate and recover Statutory Sick Pay") you’ve paid from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). Your payroll software or [HMRC’s basic PAYE tools](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/tools/basic-paye-tools.htm "Using HMRC's Basic PAYE Tools") can tell you how much you’ll get back.

      # Answer 7
      not_entitled_3_days_not_paid:
        body: |
          Your employee isn’t entitled to Statutory Sick Pay because the first 3 days of illness aren’t paid. 

          This employee has taken %{normal_workdays_out} working days off sick between %{sick_start_date} and %{sick_end_date}.

      # Answer 8
      maximum_entitlement_reached:
        body: |
          Your employee isn’t entitled to Statutory Sick Pay because they’ve already received the maximum amount of SSP (28 weeks). 

          You must send them form SSP1 within 7 days of them going off sick. They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance "Benefits & credits: employment support allowance (ESA)").
