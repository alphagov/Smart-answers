        married_woman_no_state_pension: |
          You might be able to increase your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) if you’re a woman and opted to pay the ‘Reduced Rate Election’ (also known as the Married Woman’s Stamp). You would have received the married woman’s lower basic State Pension.

          This meant that you were relying on your husband’s state pension in retirement and: 

          - paid less National Insurance contributions 
          - were an employed or self-employed woman between 1948 to 1977   
          - were married

          Where you paid the Reduced Rate Election, you’ll get a pension based on:

          - the full amount you would have got under the married woman’s’ lower-rate basic pension   
           - the full rate of the basic State Pension (if widowed or divorced)
          You’ll get more if your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.
