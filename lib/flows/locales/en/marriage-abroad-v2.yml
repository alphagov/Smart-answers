          ###Giving notice of marriage

          You’ll need to place a public announcement of your marriage in a local newspaper where you live for 1 week. If possible (and appropriate), this should be in English and the local language. It’s easier to do this in a weekly newspaper, as otherwise the announcement needs to appear for 7 consecutive days.

          You can use the example below as a template.

          on…………….….…..(date of proposed marriage).

          Any person knowing of any lawful impediment to the marriage should without delay notify:

          %{embassy_address}
          $E

          You need to wait 21 days after placing the announcement to allow for any objections to be registered. You’ll then need to swear an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) in front of a local solicitor or public notary stating that you’re free to marry.
