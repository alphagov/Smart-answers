        Estimate your penalties for late Self Assessment tax returns and payments
      body: |
        Get an estimate of how much you’ll need to pay in penalties and interest if you’ve missed the deadline for:

        - sending your Self Assessment tax return
        - paying your Self Assessment tax bill 

        This calculator will not apply to situations where you make partial payments. This calculator doesn’t take account of any partial payments you’ve made towards your tax bill.

        result_part1_penalty: |
          Your penalty for sending the return late is:

          %{late_filing_penalty}
        result_part2_no_penalty: |
          The amount of tax you owe, based on the estimate you gave:

          Total: %{total_owed}

          made up of

          %{estimated_bill} - this is what you said your tax bill is
          %{interest} - this is the interest added for paying your bill late
