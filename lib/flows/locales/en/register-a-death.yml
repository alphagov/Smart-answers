        Use this tool to find out how to register the death of someone who lived in England or Wales.

        You need to read different information if:

        - [the person lived in Scotland](http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/regscot/registering-a-death.html "registering a death - resident of Scotland"){:rel="external"}
        - [the person lived in Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/death-and-bereavement/death-and-bereavement-what-to-do-when-someone-dies/registering-a-death.htm "registering a death - resident of Northern Ireland"){:rel="external"}

      phrases:
        intro_ew: |
          $!You should register the death within 5 calendar days. You can go to any [register office](/register-offices "register office") but it’s best to use the one in the area where the person died - otherwise the process can take longer.$!

          ^Registering the death will take about 30 minutes - you might need to make an appointment.^

        intro_other: |
          $!If the death happened outside England and Wales, including on a foreign ship or foreign aircraft, you need to register the death according to the regulations of that country. The local [British embassy or consulate](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/find-an-embassy/ "find a British embassy or consulate"){:rel="external"} can help you with this.$!

          If the person died in Scotland or Northern Ireland, read about:

          - someone present at the death
          - an administrator from the hospital

        what_you_need_to_do_expected: |
          What you need to do
          --------

          Take the medical certificate showing the cause of death (signed by a doctor) with you. If available (but don't worry if not), also take the person’s:

          - birth certificate
          - marriage or civil partnership certificate

        what_you_need_to_do_unexpected: |
          What you need to do
          --------

          Take the medical certificate showing the cause of death (signed by a doctor) with you.

          If the cause of death is unknown, sudden or unexplained it may be reported to the coroner.

          You won’t have the medical certificate, but the coroner will give you the documents you need or send them direct to the registrar. The table below shows the documents needed.

          Cause of death | Documents issued by coroner
          - | -
          Natural causes | Pink Form B - form 100B so the death can be registered - this is sent direct to the registrar, but sometimes given to you
          Unnatural causes/not enough evidence of natural causes | Order for Burial (form 101) or Certificate for Cremation (form 6) so the funeral can take place - given to you; Certificate After Inquest (form 99 (rev)) - this states the cause of death and is sent to the registrar (the death is registered by the registrar with no-one present)

          ###If form 100B is issued (ie there is no inquest)

          If available (but don't worry if not), also take the person’s:

          - birth certificate
          - marriage or civil partnership certificate
          - NHS medical card

          - their last address
          - their occupation
          - the full name, date of birth and occupation of a surviving or late spouse or civil partner

          You’ll get a death certificate issued by the relevant country.

          If you want a UK death certificate as well, you can also register the death at the nearest [British embassy or consulate.](http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/find-an-embassy/ "find a British embassy or consulate"){:rel="external"} You don’t have to do this but if you do it means the death gets registered at the General Register Office in the UK.

          You can’t register a death with the British authorities in the following countries:

          - Australia
          - Canada
          - New Zealand
          - Ireland
          - South Africa

          If the body’s being brought back to England or Wales (but not from Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) to be cremated, this must be reported to the English or Welsh coroner, who needs to issue a Certificate for Cremation (form 6).

          If the body’s being brought back to England or Wales to be buried or cremated from Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, this must be reported to the local registrar so that a ‘Certificate of No Liability to Register’ can be issued. 

          ^It’s down to the person who brings the body home to contact the coroner or registrar.^
