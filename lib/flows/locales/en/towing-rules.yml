      title: "Towing: licence and age requirements"
      body: |
        Use this tool to find out if you’re old enough or have the right kind of licence to tow a trailer from different kinds of vehicle.

        This tool assumes that you already have the minimum of a full car driving licence (category B). You need a full car licence before being able to tow with any larger vehicle.

        ^A full car licence already lets you tow trailers weighing no more than 750 kg. You can also tow heavier trailers with a car as long as the total weight of vehicle and trailer isn’t more than 3,500 kg. The fully loaded trailer must also not be heavier than the unladen vehicle.^

      options:
        "no": "No"
        "yes": "Yes"

          You can already tow trailers up to 750 kg.

          You can also tow heavier trailers if the fully laden trailer weight isn’t more than the unladen vehicle weight. The combined weight of trailer and vehicle can’t be more than 3,500 kg.

          If you want to tow heavier combinations you’ll need to apply for provisional B+E entitlement than pass the B+E towing test.

          You can tow trailers up to 750 kg with a standard C1 medium-sized vehicle licence as long as the combined vehicle and trailer weight isn’t more than 8,250 kg.

          If you want to tow heavier trailers you’ll need to apply for provisional C1+E entitlement then pass the C1+E test.

          This lets you have a restricted C1+E entitlement because you’re under 21. It lets you tow trailers heavier than 750 kg as long as the combined vehicle and trailer weight isn’t more than 7,500 kg.

          Once you’re 21 you’ll automatically get the full C1+E entitlement and you can tow combinations up to 12,000 kg. The fully-loaded trailer can’t weigh more than the unladen vehicle.
