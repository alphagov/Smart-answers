          This is an estimate based on the income figures you provided. 

          The result may be different if your income changes during the tax year.

      estimated_tax_charge:
        title: The person with the highest income will have to pay £%{benefit_tax}.
        body: |
          Child Benefit | Your results
          -|- 
          Child Benefit you get for the tax year | £%{benefit_claimed_amount}
          Child Benefit that's counted when working out the tax to pay | £%{benefit_taxable_amount}
          Percentage of Child Benefit you must pay as tax | %{percentage_tax_charge}%

          You can either:

          - carry on getting Child Benefit and whoever has the highest income in your household pays £%{benefit_tax} through the [Self Assessment system](/self-assessment-tax-returns "Self Assessment tax returns")
          - tell the [Child Benefit office](/child-benefit-office "Child Benefit Office") that you want to stop claiming Child Benefit

          ^ If someone stops claiming Child Benefit and they’re not working, they won’t automatically get [National Insurance credits](boost-state-pension "Boost your State pension") towards their State pension. ^

          This is an estimate based on the income figures you provided.

          The result may be different if your income changes during a tax year.
