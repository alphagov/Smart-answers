        title: How many qualifying years do you have?
        body: |
          'Qualifying years' means years you've made National Insurance contributions or years you could get credit for.

          You usually get qualifying years if you're:

          - in paid full-time or part-time work
          - self-employed
          - caring for someone for over 20 hours a week
          - getting Child Benefit
          - receiving certain benefits 
          - in full-time training
      answer:
        title: You'll get £%{what_you_get} a week of basic State Pension.
        body: |
          The basic State Pension goes up each year by whichever is the **highest**:

          - the average percentage growth in wages in Great Britain
          - average price increases (the 'Consumer Price Index', or CPI)
          - 2.5%

          Based on the current law, this means the basic State Pension in March of %{state_pension_year} (the year you reach State Pension age) will be a **minimum** of £%{you_get_future} a week (it's increased each April). If average wages or prices increase by more than 2.5%, you'll get more.
