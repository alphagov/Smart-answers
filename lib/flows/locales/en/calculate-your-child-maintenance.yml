        - you need information about your income
        - if you have children with more than 1 person, you must make a separate calculation for each person you want to have a child maintenance agreement with

        Check the [child maintenance rates](/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/rates-used-by-the-child-support-agency "child maintenance rates") before you use the calculator.

      phrases:
