          ###What to do for your tax return

          You’ll have to work out the split between private and business use for vehicles, working from home or business premise use. 

          You’ll then have to add up your expenses for your tax return and [keep records](/self-employed-records) for every expense you want to claim, eg copies of your bills. 

          ^This is an estimate. You should do your own calculations for your tax return.^

        body: |
          You can’t use simplified expenses for your current vehicle because you’ve already claimed Capital Allowances for it.
