          However, if you earn more than this in a single pay packet (eg

          employer can choose to delay your enrolment date.

          This means your contract may end before you are enrolled. If you

          If you want to opt out, you should do this before the deadline to get any payments refunded. 

          If you stay in the scheme, you and your employer will both pay into your pension pot, and the government will also contribute through tax relief.

          Your employer will give you more information about the scheme they've chosen.
