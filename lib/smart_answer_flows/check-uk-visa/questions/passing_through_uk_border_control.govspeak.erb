  Will you pass through UK Border Control?

<% content_for :body do %>
  You always pass through border control if you:


  - leave the main airport building for any reason
  - need to collect your bags and check them in to your onward flight - contact your airline if youâ€™re not sure whether your bags will be checked through
  - are travelling on to the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands

  You must also pass through border control if both:

  - your onward flight leaves on a different calendar day to when you arrive
  - there's nowhere for you to stay overnight in the airport, eg in a transit hotel

  ^Contact your airline to find out if the airport you're travelling to has a transit hotel or any other overnight facilities.^
