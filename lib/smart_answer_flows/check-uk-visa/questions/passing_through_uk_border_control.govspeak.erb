<% content_for :body do %>
  You pass through border control if you do any of the following:

  - leave the main airport building for any reason
  - collect your bags and check them in to your onward flight
  - travel on to the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands

  You also pass through border control if both:

  - your onward flight leaves on a different day to when you arrive
  - thereâ€™s nowhere for you to stay overnight in the airport, eg in a transit hotel

  ^Contact your airline if you're not sure if you'll pass through border control.^
