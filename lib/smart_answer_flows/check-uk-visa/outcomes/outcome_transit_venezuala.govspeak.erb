    ^If you don’t have an ePassport, you must [apply for a transit visa](/transit-visa).^

    ##Transiting without a visa

    You might be eligible for the 'transit without a visa concession' if you don't have an ePassport, so long as:

    - you arrive and depart by air

    - have a confirmed onward flight which leaves within 24 hours

    - have the right documents for your destination (eg a visa for that country)

    One of the following must also apply:

    - you’re travelling to Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country

    - you’re travelling from Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and it’s less than 6 months since you last entered that country with a valid entry visa

    - you have a valid US permanent residence card issued on or after 21 April 1998 (or an I-797 extension letter issued by the Bureau of Citizenship if it’s expired)

    - you have a valid Canadian permanent resident card issued on or after 28 June 2002

    - you have a valid uniform format category D visa for entry to a state in the European Economic Area (EEA)

    - you have a valid uniform format residence permit issued by an EEA state

    %The ‘transit without visa concession’ is decided by the immigration officer at the border. You won’t be allowed to transit if they decide you need a visa, so you might want to apply for a transit visa before you travel.%
