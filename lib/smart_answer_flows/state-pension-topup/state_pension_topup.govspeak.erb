Until 5 April 2017, you can make a payment to top up your State Pension by up to £25 per week. How much you’ll need to pay depends on:

* how much extra pension you want to get per week
* how old you are when you make the payment

The older you are, the less you'll pay. Calculate how much you'll need to contribute.
