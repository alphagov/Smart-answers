  Pay and leave for parents
<% end %>

<% content_for :body do %>
  Find out:

  * if you can get maternity, paternity or shared parental leave
  * how much pay you can get if you take leave

  ## Before you start

  You’ll need to know:

  * your employment status (for example employed or worker)
  * the date you started your current job
  * the date you finished work (if you’ve finished)
  * how much you earn

  You’ll need the same information about your partner if you plan to share the care of the child with them.

  ^Use this calculator once for each job you have.^
