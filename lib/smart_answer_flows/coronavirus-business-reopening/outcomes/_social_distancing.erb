## How to ensure social distancing on site

You should always:

- stay 2 metres apart from other employees and customers (or 1 metre with risk mitigation where 2 metres is not viable)
- wash hands and clean surfaces more regularly
- put up signs and use floor tape to remind people to keep social distance
- keep the number of employees on site to a minimum
- wash your hands and clothes after helping someone in an emergency
- make sure you have enough appropriately trained staff to keep people safe (for example, having dedicated staff to encourage social distancing or to manage security)
- limit access to the kitchen
- limit contact between the kitchen workers and other employees (also when on breaks)
- have screens between equipment in larger kitchens
- have one person at a time getting things from the pantry, fridge and freezer
- minimise contact with other employees when handing over food
- ask employees to change into work uniforms on site (providing changing areas where social distancing is possible)
- wash staff uniforms on site where possible and not let employees take them home
- keep the activity time as short as possible
- space out client chairs and workstations, and place screens or barriers to separate customers
- advise workers to wear visors when working within 2 metres of clients
- move seating in waiting areas to encourage social distancing
- work side by side or back-to-back rather than face-to-face
- have fixed teams to minimise exposure
- provide training for workers on new ways of working

Where you cannot stay 2 metres apart (or 1 metre with risk mitigation where 2 metres is not viable) you should:

- only work together up to 15 minutes at a time
- use screens and barriers to separate people where possible
- work side by side or back-to-back rather than face-to-face
- have fixed teams to minimise exposure

### Entrances and exits

You should:

- stagger arrival and departure times
- open more entrances and exits to the site
- use screens in reception areas
- mark a one-way flow where possible
- provide hand washing facilities or hand sanitiser
- provide more parking
- provide facilities to help people cycle, run or walk to work (for example, bike racks)
- make sure it's safe to queue and not in the way of traffic (for example, you can route the queues behind permanent physical structures such as street furniture, bike racks or bollards, or put up barriers)

### Moving around the site

You should:

- close off areas that are not essential
- put up signs to use stairs instead of lifts whenever possible, while keeping access to lifts for disabled people
- review layouts and processes to allow employees to work further apart from each other, for example by assigning employees to specific areas of the restaurant or sections of the bar or counter
- ask people to store personal items in lockers if possible
- control the use of corridors, lifts and similar areas, for example with markings on the floor
- have floor markings where people queue (for example, toilets)
- stagger break times and, if possible, have breaks outdoors
- arrange seating in break areas 2 metres apart (or 1 metre with risk mitigation)
- keep the number of people to a minimum for construction site inductions and have them outdoors where possible
- have separate entrances and exits for people working in high-risk areas (for example, mechanical test sites and wet labs)
- ask employees to change into lab clothing and equipment on site and not take it home (provide changing areas where social distancing is possible)
- wash lab clothing and equipment like goggles instead of employees doing this at home
- make sure the smallest possible number of people share equipment and workstations
- put up screens where you cannot put workstations 2 metres apart
- reduce the number of people using a lab at one time (for example, by booking it)
- limit the number of people handling equipment
- make sure air filters in high-risk areas are installed and maintained to reduce the risk from airborne particles
- avoid hotdesking as much as possible
- sanitise workstations between occupants where people share
- rearrange desks to avoid face-to-face working
- use 2 metre floor markings outside the shop to organise queues
- have a one-way flow through the shop where possible
- minimise contact when customers are paying (for example, by using contactless)
- think about how to display promotional materials to allow employees and customers to stay 2 metres apart
- encourage employees to stay on site during the day - if they go out, for example for lunch, they should social distance

  ### Working in other people’s homes

  To minimise risk from travelling to the home you should:

  - regularly clean company vehicles used for transport
  - limit the number of passengers
  - match workers to nearby locations to limit any transport
  - allocate workers to the same teams and homes every day
  - make appointments online or over the phone

  At the home you should:

  - wash your hands when you arrive and leave
  - ask for all doors in the home to be open so you do not have to touch handles
  - avoid busy spaces like corridors where possible
  - bring your own food to avoid going outside
  - not share things like pens and devices

  ### Managing service of food and drink

  You should:

  - maintain social distancing (2 metres apart, or 1 metre with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable) from customers when taking orders from customers
  - minimise customers’ self-service of food, cutlery and condiments to reduce risk of transmission
  - encourage contactless payments where possible and adjust the location of card readers to follow social distancing guidelines
  - provide only disposable condiments or cleaning non-disposable condiment containers after each use.
  - reducing the number of surfaces touched by both staff and customers
  - minimise contact between front-of-house workers and customers at points of service where appropriate
  - ensure all outdoor areas, especially covered areas, have sufficient ventilation

  ### Restaurants with takeaway and delivery

  You should:

  - encourage customers to order online or over the phone
  - minimise contact between kitchen employees and front-of-house or delivery drivers by arranging drop-off and pick up points
  - set out floor markings and signs to encourage takeaway customers and delivery drivers to maintain social distancing (see government guidance on food safety for food delivery)

  ### Using vehicles

  You should: 

  - leave room in the vehicle, for example leave seats free in minibuses
  - assign the same workers to the same routes and roles
  - reduce the number of workers at depots and distribution centres where possible
  - have collection slots for picking up goods
  - load vehicles without contact with the driver
  - avoid having 2 people for deliveries, for example by delaying bigger orders, or have fixed pairs if this is not possible
