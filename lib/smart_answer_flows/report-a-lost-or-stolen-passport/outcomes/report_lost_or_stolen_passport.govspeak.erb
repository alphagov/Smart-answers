You can cancel your passport immediately by [reporting it online](https://www.loststolenpassport.service.gov.uk/report/passport-holder).

You’ll need to provide a UK mobile number. If you don’t have one, you can use an email address and a landline number.

You'll need to [apply for a replacement passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/overview) if you want one.

^If you [replace your passport using the paper application form](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/replace), fill in section 3 to report your missing passport - you don’t need to report it online as well.^

%You can’t use the [1-day Premium service](https://www.gov.uk/get-a-passport-urgently) if you’re replacing a lost passport.%
