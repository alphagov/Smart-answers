##How this is worked out

The total amount of your benefits are added together:

Total amount of benefits affected by cap: £<%= total_benefits %>

As this amount is lower than your benefit cap of £<%= benefit_cap %>, your benefits won’t change.

This is an estimate only. Contact the Department for Work and Pensions if you need further help.
