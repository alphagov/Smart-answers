  Based on your answers, you'll be affected by the benefit cap as you get <%= format_money(total_benefits_amount) %> in benefits and your benefit cap is <%= format_money(benefit_cap) %>.
<% end %>

<% content_for :body do %>
  Your Housing Benefit will be: <%= format_money(new_housing_benefit) %>.

  ##How this is worked out

  The benefits you get are added together. The total amount of benefits over your benefit cap is subtracted from your Housing Benefit:

  Total amount of benefits affected by cap: <%= format_money(total_benefits_amount) %>

  Your Housing Benefit is reduced by the amount you are over your benefit cap of <%= format_money(benefit_cap) %>:

  Total benefits affected: <%= format_money(total_benefits_amount) %>

  Minus benefit cap: <%= format_money(benefit_cap) %>

  Total over cap: <%= format_money(total_over_cap) %>

  Housing benefit: <%= format_money(housing_benefit_amount) %>

  Minus total over cap: <%= format_money(total_over_cap) %>

  New Housing Benefit amount: <%= format_money(new_housing_benefit) %>

  <% if new_housing_benefit_amount < 0.5 %>
    Your Housing Benefit wonâ€™t be reduced to 0. You need to be getting some Housing Benefit to be eligible for other services.
