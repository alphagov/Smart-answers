  Based on your answers, you’re not affected by the Greater London benefit cap.
<% end %>

<% content_for :body do %>
  This is because the total amount of benefits you get are the same as or lower than this benefit cap.

  ##How this is worked out

  The total amount of your benefits are added together:

  Total amount of benefits affected by cap: <%= format_money(total_benefits_amount) %>

  As this amount is lower than your benefit cap of <%= format_money(benefit_cap) %>, your benefits won’t change.

  This is an estimate only. Contact the Department for Work and Pensions if you need further help.
