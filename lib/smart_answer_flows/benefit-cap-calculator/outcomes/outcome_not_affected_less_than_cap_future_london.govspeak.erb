  Based on your answers, you won’t be affected by the Greater London benefit cap from 7 November 2016.
<% end %>

<% content_for :body do %>
  This is because the total amount of benefits you get are the same as or lower than this benefit cap.

  ##How this is worked out

  The total amount of your benefits are added together:

  Total amount of benefits affected by cap: £<%= total_benefits_amount %>

  As this amount is lower than your benefit cap of £<%= benefit_cap %>, your benefits won’t change.

  You can check if you’re affected by the [current benefit cap](/benefit-cap-calculator/y/default).

  This is an estimate only. Contact the Department for Work and Pensions if you need further help.
