      result_1:
        body: |
          $!The child isn't affected by Personal Independence Payment (PIP) because they're under 16.$!

          To qualify for PIP the child must be 16 or over.

          Instead of PIP, you can make a claim for [Disability Living Allowance](/disability-living-allowance-children) for the child until they turn 16.

        body: |
          $!You aren't affected by Personal Independence Payment (PIP) because you are aged 65 or over.$!

          To qualify for PIP you must be aged 16 to 64.

          Instead of PIP, you can make a claim for [Attendance Allowance](/attendance-allowance) (you won't normally qualify for Disability Living Allowance because you're 65 or over).

      result_3:
        body: |
          $!You can make a claim for [Personal Independence Payment (PIP)](/pip).$!

          You can no longer make a claim for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) because PIP has replaced DLA for people aged 16 to 64.

        body: |
          $!You shouldn't be affected by Personal Independence Payment (PIP) until 2015 or later, but there are some exceptions.$!

          You don't need to do anything now - you'll get a letter in 2015 or later explaining:

          + what will happen to your Disability Living Allowance (DLA)
          + how you can claim PIP

          ##Exceptions

          You’ll be invited to claim PIP if either:

          + there’s a change in how your condition affects you
          + your DLA is due to end and you haven’t received a renewal letter

          This applies if you live in:

          - Wales
          - East Midlands
          - West Midlands
          - East Anglia

      result_5:
        body: |
          $!You can continue to claim Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for the child for now – but there are some exceptions.$!

          ##Exceptions

          The child will be invited to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP) on or shortly after they turn 16 if they live in:

          - Wales
          - East Midlands
          - West Midlands
          - East Anglia

      result_6:
        body: |
          $!You aren’t affected by Personal Independence Payment (PIP).$!

          Because you were aged 65 or over on 8 April 2013 when PIP was introduced, you can continue to get [Disability Living Allowance](/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit) for as long as you're eligible.
