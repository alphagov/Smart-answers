          $!You shouldn't be affected by Personal Independence Payment (PIP) until 2015 or later, but there are some exceptions.$!

          You don't need to do anything now - you'll get a letter in 2015 or later explaining:

          + what will happen to your Disability Living Allowance (DLA)
          + how you can claim PIP

          ##Exceptions

          You’ll be invited to claim PIP if either:

          + there’s a change in how your condition affects you
          + your DLA is due to end and you haven’t received a renewal letter

          This applies if you live in:

          - Wales
          - East Midlands
          - West Midlands
          - East Anglia

          $!You can continue to claim Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for the child for now – but there are some exceptions.$!

          ##Exceptions

          Your child will normally get a letter before they turn 16 inviting them to apply for PIP if they live in:

          - Wales
          - East Midlands
          - West Midlands
          - East Anglia

          Contact the [Disability Benefits helpline](/disability-benefits-helpline) if their sixteenth birthday is in less than 28 days and they haven’t received this. Their payment may stop if you don’t.
