        description: You can calculate if you’re affected by the benefit cap
      body: |
        There’s a limit on the total amount of benefits that most people aged 16 to 64 can get. This is called the [benefit cap](/benefit-cap).

        This calculator gives an estimate of how much your benefit might be capped.

        ^You can't check if you're affected by the benefit cap if you're claiming [Universal Credit](/universal-credit).^

        You’ll need to know the amounts of each benefit you get to use the calculator and the number of people in your household.

        Your household includes you, your partner and any children that you’re responsible for and who live with you.
      options:
        "yes": "Yes"
        "no": "No"
