        Get the probate and Inheritance Tax forms you need.

        Probate (‘Confirmation’ in Scotland) is a process that gives you the legal right to deal with someone’s estate (money, property and possessions) after they die. This is usually done by the person named as the ‘executor’ in the will, or the next of kin if there is no will.

        To register for probate you need to fill in certain forms. Inheritance Tax is part of the probate process, even if the estate doesn’t owe any.

        A solicitor can apply for probate for you:
