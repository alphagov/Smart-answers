      body: |
        If you think a decision about your benefits is wrong, you can ask for an explanation,
        challenge the decision or appeal against it. If your query is about child maintenance or tax credits, these aren't benefits
        but you can still:


        * [appeal a child maintenance decision](/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency/appeal-a-decision "appeal a decision about child maintenance")
        * [appeal a tax credits decision](/tax-credits-appeals-complaints "Appeal or complain about a tax credits decision")

          The decision letter from Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service (HMCTS) will tell you what to do if you want to challenge their decision.
        body: |
          If the tribunal agrees that there was a problem with the hearing, they will:

          * cancel (set aside) the decision
          * arrange a new hearing

          You have 1 month after getting a decision to ask for it to be cancelled (set aside).

          Remember that the other side in your appeal are also allowed to challenge a decision if they think it’s wrong.

          The decision letter from Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service (HMCTS) will tell you what
          to do if you want to challenge their decision.
        body: |
          If you think the tribunal made a mistake in the law, you can ask for them to explain their
          decision in a 'statement of reasons'.

          This can include many aspects of the decision, so get advice (eg from
          [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm "get advice from Citizens Advice"){:rel="external"})
          if you’re not sure of your rights.

          You have 1 month after getting a decision to ask for a statement of reasons.

          If you still think they didn’t apply the law correctly, you can ask for permission to appeal
          to the Upper Tribunal. You have 1 month after getting a statement of reasons to do this.

          The Upper Tribunal is made up of experienced lawyers who specialise in benefits law. If they
          agree that the decision was wrong, they can:

          * make a different decision
          * cancel (set aside) the decision and arrange a new hearing

          You have 1 month after getting a statement of reasons to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

          You can’t appeal to the Upper Tribunal about:

          * facts the tribunal have used
          * the tribunal’s medical findings or conclusions

          Remember that the other side in your appeal are also allowed to challenge a decision if they
          think it’s wrong.

      ask_for_an_explanation:
        title: |
          You can contact your benefits office using the details on your decision letter to ask for more information. You should do this as soon as possible if you’re thinking about appealing the decision.
        body: |
          You normally have 1 month after you got the decision to start an appeal. It’s up to you whether you prefer to:

          * speak to someone at the benefits office
          * speak to someone on the phone
          * get a written ‘statement of reasons’

          If you ask for a written statement of reasons and this is provided within the original 1 month dispute period, you will be given an extra 2 weeks to make an appeal.

          If it’s provided later, the 2 weeks will run from the date it was sent to you.

          Once you’ve had an explanation, if still not happy with the decision you may be able to:

          * ask the benefits office to look at it again (reconsider)
          * appeal against the decision

          You may still be able ask the benefits office to look at their decision again (reconsider),
          particularly if your situation has changed since it was made.

          ^If your circumstances have changed since the decision was made, let the benefits office
          know.^

          If they change the decision more than 1 month after it was made, you normally won&apos;t
          get any 'backdated' benefits. This means you’ll only get the new amount from the date of the changed decision.

        title: |
          You can contact your benefits office using the details on your decision letter, and ask
          them to look at it again (reconsider).
        body: |
          Normally, someone else at the benefits office will do this -- not the person who made the
          first decision. If they agree that they've made a mistake, they'll give you a new decision
          and you may not need to appeal.

          They might ask you for new information about why you think the first decision was wrong.
          If they do, you should give it to them as soon as possible.

          If you think your Jobcentre Plus office made the wrong decision, you can ask them to look at it again (reconsider).

          If you still don’t agree with the decision, you can ask the [Independent Review Service](http://www.irs-review.org.uk/irsreview/review.htm "Independent Review Service"){:rel="external"}  to review it.

          You can do this by filling in the form on the leaflet, ‘Did you get what you wanted?’. Your Jobcentre Plus should have sent this leaflet with your decision letter. You can also download a copy.

          ##What happens next

          A review isn’t the same as a tribunal, and there won’t be a hearing. Your Jobcentre Plus office will send the papers about your benefit to an inspector as soon as your form arrives.

          They might contact you to ask for more information.

          If they agree that your Jobcentre Plus office has made a mistake, they will change the decision.

          ##Help with your review

          If you need any help with things like filling in forms, or what to do if the inspector asks you for more information, you can contact the [Citizens Advice Bureau](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm "Citizens Advice Bureau"){:rel="external"}.
