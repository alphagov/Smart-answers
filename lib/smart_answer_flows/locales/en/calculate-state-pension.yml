        ##What you need to know:

        This calculator gives an estimate of your basic State pension and information about the [new State Pension](/new-state-pension) if you reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016.

        It doesn’t estimate any [Additional State Pension.](/additional-state-pension)

        You’ll be asked for the number of years you worked and paid National Insurance or got certain benefits. These are the years of your [National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance) that count towards your State Pension.

        Count tax years from 6 April to 5 April and don’t count any years twice (eg when you were working and getting benefits). Don’t count the current tax year.

        This calculator uses a simplified calculation based on the current law. It can’t take into account every circumstance that might affect you. Don't make future financial decisions based on its results.
