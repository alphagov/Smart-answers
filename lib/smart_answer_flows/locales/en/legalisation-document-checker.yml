          Your %{document_type} can be legalised if it’s either:

          - an official certified copy of the certificate issued by the General Register Office (GRO) with the original seal

          - an original certificate (or original certified copy) issued by a church, religious establishment or local register office, with the original signature of the official who issued the certificate

          ##Certifying documents

          If you provide a certified document, it must be certified in the UK by a solicitor or ‘notary public’.

          When the solicitor or notary public signs the document, they must:

          - note the type of certification they have done (eg the document is a true copy of the original)
          - use their personal signature, not a company signature
          - include the date of certification
          - include their company address

          If they add a notarial certificate, it must be attached to the document. The certificate must also  contain a specific reference to the document they have certified.

          If a notary public from England, Wales or Northern Ireland signs a document for legalisation, they must also stamp or emboss the document with their notarial seal.
