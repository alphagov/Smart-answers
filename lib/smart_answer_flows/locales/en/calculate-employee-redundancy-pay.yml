          Statutory redundancy payment: £%{statutory_redundancy_pay} (£%{statutory_redundancy_pay_ni} In Northern Ireland).
        body: |
          ##How it’s worked out

          Your employee's entitlement is %{number_of_weeks_entitlement} weeks.

          They get:

          + 0.5 week’s pay for each full year they were under 22
          + 1 week’s pay for each full year they were 22 or older, but under 41
          + 1.5 week’s pay for each full year they were 41 or older

          Length of service is capped at 20 years and weekly pay at £%{rate} (£%{ni_rate} In Northern Ireland). Years of service or earnings over these amounts are not included in the calculation.

          The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is £%{max_amount} (£%{ni_max_amount} In Northern Ireland).

          ^Redundancy pay under £30,000 is not taxable.^
