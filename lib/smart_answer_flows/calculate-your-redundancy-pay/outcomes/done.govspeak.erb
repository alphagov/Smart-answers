  ##How it’s worked out

  Pay is capped at <%= format_money(rate) %> (<%= format_money(ni_rate) %> in Northern Ireland) per week. Length of service is capped at 20 years.

  ^The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is <%= format_money(max_amount) %> (<%= format_money(ni_max_amount) %> in Northern Ireland)^

  Years of service or earnings over these amounts aren’t included in the calculation.

  You can’t get less than the statutory amount but you may get more if your employer has a redundancy scheme. Redundancy pay up to £30,000 is tax-free.

  Your entitlement is <%= number_of_weeks_entitlement %> weeks.

  You get:

  + 0.5 week’s pay for each full year worked when you’re under 22
  + 1 week’s pay for each full year worked when you’re between 22 and 41
  + 1.5 week’s pay for each full year worked when you’re 41 or older
