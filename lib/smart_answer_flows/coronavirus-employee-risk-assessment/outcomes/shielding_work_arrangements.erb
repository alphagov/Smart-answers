    ## You should work from home or get support if you cannot

    You should work from home, and your employer is expected to help and support you.

    If your job cannot be done from home, you should discuss options with your employer.

    ### When rules will change:
    
    From 1 August 2020:

    - you should adopt strict social distancing rather than full shielding measures
    - if you cannot work from home, you can go to work (as long as the business is COVID-safe)
    - you should remain cautious as you are still at risk of severe illness if you catch coronavirus (stay home or practical social distancing as much as possible)
    - the support from the National Shielding Service of free food parcels, medicine deliveries and care will stop
    - NHS Volunteer Responders will carry on delivering the food you buy, prescriptions and essential items to you if you need it
    - you will still be eligible for priority supermarket slots (if you registered by 17 July)
