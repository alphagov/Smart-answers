##What you need to do

You’ll need to get a certificate of no impediment (CNI) from the authorities in the UK to prove you’re allowed to register a civil partnership.

^Your partner will need to follow the same process to get their own CNI.^

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Italy to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

###Getting a statutory declaration

While you’re waiting for your CNI, you and your partner will need to make a statutory declaration before a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/) in the UK. The Italian authorities will need this in addition to your CNI. There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the civil partnership to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%
