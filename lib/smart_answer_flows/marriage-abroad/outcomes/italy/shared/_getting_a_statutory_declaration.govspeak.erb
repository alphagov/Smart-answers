###Getting a statutory declaration

While you’re waiting for your CNI, you will need to make a statutory declaration before a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/). The Italian authorities will need this in addition to your CNI. There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.
