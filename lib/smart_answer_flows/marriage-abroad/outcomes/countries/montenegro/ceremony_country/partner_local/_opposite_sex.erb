Contact the relevant local authorities in Montenegro to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You need to prove you're legally allowed to get married by getting a certificate of no impediment (CNI) and making an affirmation at the British embassy.

###Get a CNI and make an affirmation

To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in Montenegro. You can do this at the British embassy. It costs <% when :affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage %> to give notice and make your affirmation at the embassy and <% when :issuing_cni_or_nulla_osta %> for your CNI.

You’ll need to have been living in Montenegro for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, for example if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Podgorica](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-podgorica/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker) to post notice and make an affirmation.

You can make your affirmation that you are free to marry at your appointment to post notice.

You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate 
- equivalent documents for your partner

You’ll need to complete a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form and an [‘Affirmation’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%


###If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before

You’ll need to take one of the following documents:

- your [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a printed PDF certified in the country where you got divorced) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your previous partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

You can provide copies of a divorce decree or death certificate instead of originals. They’ll need to be certified by a notary public or solicitor in the country where the divorce took place or the death was registered.

You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.

###What happens next

The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath.

The embassy will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.

You don’t need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.

##Get married

You’ll need to give your CNI and affirmation to the person who’s going to marry you.

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Montenegro
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)          

You cannot register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/british-citizenship/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
