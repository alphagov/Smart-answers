Contact the relevant local authorities in Morocco to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Morocco to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport, your partner’s passport and pay a fee.

Make an appointment at the [embassy in Rabat](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-rabat/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker) or the [British Honorary Consulate Marrakech](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-honorary-consulate-marrakech/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker).

^Your partner must get an affirmation as well.^

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

^An ’affirmation for marriage’ document issued in Morocco is valid for 3 months.^
