Contact the [Embassy of Ecuador](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked for an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

To swear an affirmation or affidavit, [make an appointment at the British Embassy Quito](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-quito/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker).

You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation or affidavit as well.^

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%
