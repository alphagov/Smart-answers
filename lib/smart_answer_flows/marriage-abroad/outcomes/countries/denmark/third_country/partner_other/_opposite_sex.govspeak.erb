Contact the relevant local authorities in Denmark to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Denmark](/foreign-travel-advice/denmark) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You should apply for a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office, National Records of Scotland or nidirect.

If you can’t apply for a ‘no trace letter’ you can get a certificate of no impediment (CNI) from the British Embassy or UK registrar.

###No trace letters

The Danish authorities will accept a ‘no trace letter’. It can take up to 3 weeks for a ‘no trace letter’ to be issued.

If you are in England or Wales, you can get a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office. Ask them to make a search and quote reference ‘SEARCH 123’.

If you are in Scotland, you can get a ’to whom it may concern’ letter from the [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/getting-married-abroad/what-documents-will-i-need-to-provide).

If you are in Northern Ireland, you can get a ‘certificate of legal capacity to marry' or a ‘marriage index search’ from [nidirect](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/marriage-outside-uk).

###Certificate of no impediment (CNI)

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/denmark/uk/partner_other/opposite_sex)
- [go to Denmark and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/denmark/ceremony_country/partner_other/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice, you’ll normally have to wait at least 13 days for your CNI. It can take longer depending on the local authorities’ processes and the time of year.%

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
