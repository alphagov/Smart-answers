Contact the relevant local authorities in India to find out about local marriage laws, including
what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for India](/foreign-travel-advice/india) before making any plans.^

The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth
countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document
to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Download and print the [information note on ‘no objection certificates’](/government/publications/marriage-information-note-on-noc) and show it to the
registrar.

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in India
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

*[CNI]: certificate of no impediment
