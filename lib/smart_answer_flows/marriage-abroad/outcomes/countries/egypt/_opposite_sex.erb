## Before you start

Contact the local notary office where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you'll need.

If you're divorced you need to get legal advice to check that your divorce is valid in Egypt.

^Check the [travel advice for Egypt](/foreign-travel-advice/egypt) before making any plans.^

## Prove you're free to get married

You need to go to the embassy in Egypt to confirm that you're legally allowed to get married. This is called swearing an affirmation.

This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage) %> per person. You can pay by card, or if you ask the consular officer for the embassy's bank details you can make a cash deposit. 

Download, fill in and print an [affirmation form](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/686639/Marriage_Affirmation_Template.ods).

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Cairo](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=107&service=13) to swear your affirmation.

You’ll need to bring supporting documents to your appointment, including:

- the affirmation form 
- your passport
- evidence if you've changed your name by deed poll

The affirmation will be signed and stamped by a consular officer. It's valid for 1 month from when it's issued.

###If you've been married or in a civil partnership before

You’ll need to bring documents to your appointment to prove the end of any previous marriages or civil partnerships. Depending on how it ended, this will be:

- an original decree absolute or final order (this might be a PDF certified in the country where you got divorced) 
- an annulment certificate 
- a civil partnership dissolution 
- your husband, wife or civil partner’s death certificate and the marriage certificate

You can provide a copy of a UK decree or death certificate instead of an original. You'll need to get it certified by the Egyptian consulate of the country where the divorce took place or the death was registered.

If you were in an opposite sex marriage or opposite sex civil partnership before, you’ll need to get the documents legalised by:

- the Egyptian consulate of the country where the marriage or civil partnership ended 
- the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs when you’re in Egypt

If you were in a same sex marriage or same sex civil partnership before, do not get the documents legalised. Same sex relationships are not legally recognised in Egypt - you may be arrested or made to leave the country. You should still bring the documents to your appointment at the embassy.

### Women divorcees and widows

If you're a woman and you've been married before, you can get married:

- 3 months after the divorce (or until your baby is born, if you're pregnant)
- 3 months after your husband's death, if you're widowed

### Your partner's nationality

If your partner is British, they'll need to swear their own affirmation.

If your partner is Egyptian, they'll need to come with you to the embassy to show:

- their current Egyptian ID card and passport
- that they're not married (divorces must be irrevocable)

If they’re not from the UK or Egypt, they'll need to:

- ask the embassy of their country what documents prove that they’re free to marry
- get a letter from the embassy of their country that shows their marriage status, for example single or divorced

### Legalise your affirmation

Take your affirmation to be ‘legalised' (certified as genuine) by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You don't need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn't a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they've lived in the UK for 3 years.
