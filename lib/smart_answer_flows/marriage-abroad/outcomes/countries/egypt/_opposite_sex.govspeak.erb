## Before you start

Contact the local district office where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you'll need.

If you're divorced you need to get legal advice to check that your divorce is valid in Egypt.

^Check the [travel advice for Egypt](/foreign-travel-advice/egypt) before making any plans.^

## Prove you're free to get married

You need to go to the embassy in Egypt to confirm that you're legally allowed to get married. This is called swearing an affirmation.

This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage) %> per person. You can pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/egypt-consular-fees) with cash or card.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Cairo](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-cairo/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker) to swear your affirmation.

You'll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- evidence if you've changed your name by deed poll

The affirmation will be signed and stamped by a consular officer. It's valid for 1 month from when it's issued.

### If you've been married or in a civil partnership before

You'll need to take documents to prove the end of any previous marriages or civil partnerships. Depending on how it ended, this will be:

- an original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this might be a PDF certified in the country where you got divorced)
- an annulment certificate
- a civil partnership dissolution
- your husband, wife or civil partner's [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and the marriage certificate

You can provide copies of a UK decree or death certificate instead of originals. They'll need to be certified by a notary public or solicitor in the country where the divorce took place or the death was registered.

If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you'll need:

- evidence that you or your former partner lived in (or were a national of) that country at the time
- a visa which was valid in the country where it happened

You'll need to get any documentation legalised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (or equivalent) and the Egyptian consulate in the country where that happened.

### Women divorcees and widows

If you're a woman and you've been married before, you can get married:

- 3 months after the divorce (or until your baby is born, if you're pregnant)
- 4 months and 10 days after your husband's death, if you're widowed

### Your partner's nationality

If your partner is British, they'll need to swear their own affirmation.

If your partner is Egyptian, they'll need to come with you to the embassy to show:

- their current Egyptian ID card and passport
- that they're not married (divorces must be irrevocable)

If they're not from the UK or Egypt, they should ask the Notary Public Office what documents prove they're free to marry.

### Legalise your affirmation

Take your statutory declaration to be â€˜legalised' (certified as genuine) by the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mfa.gov.eg/).

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Egypt
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You don't need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn't a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they've lived in the UK for 3 years.
