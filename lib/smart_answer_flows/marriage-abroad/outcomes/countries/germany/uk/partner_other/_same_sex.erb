##Before you start

Contact the Civil Registry Office (‘Standesamt’) or church where you plan to marry to find out about local marriage laws.

You must have a consultation with a Standesamt before making any further arrangements. They’ll let you know about the procedure and which documents you’ll need. If one of you does not speak German, you’ll also need to bring a [qualified interpreter](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/420647/translators_interpreters_germany.pdf) to your appointment.

^You should [get legal advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

* you follow the correct process according to the law in Germany
* it would be [allowed under UK law](https://www.gov.uk/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You do not need to register your marriage in the UK.

If you need extra copies of your marriage certificate, you can apply for them at the Standesamt where you got married.

###Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](https://www.gov.uk/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
