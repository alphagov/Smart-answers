You may be able to register a civil partnership or get married at the British embassy or consulate in Cambodia.

You must post notice of your marriage at the British embassy in Phnom Penh.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Phnom Penh.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-phnom-penh/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)

##What documents you’ll need

You’ll both need to bring proof that you’ve been resident in Cambodia for the last 7 days.

You’ll both need your original passports. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need either:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

At your appointment the embassy or consulate will give you:

-  a notice of registration
-  a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry or enter into a civil partnership

Once you’ve completed these and paid the registration fee, the embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.

As long as nobody registers an objection you can get married or enter into a civil partnership up to 3 months after you gave notice.

You’ll need to bring two witnesses to your ceremony - they’ll need to show their photo ID (for example passport or driver’s licence).

You’ll need to pay a fee to register your marriage or civil partnership and a fee for your marriage or civil partnership certificate.

^All same-sex marriages must take place under English and Welsh or Scottish law even if you live in or are from Northern Ireland. Tell the embassy or consulate which law you want to get married under at your appointment.^
