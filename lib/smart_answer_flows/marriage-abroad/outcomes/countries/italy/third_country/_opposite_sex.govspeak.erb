## Before you start

Contact the local town hall (‘comune’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you and your partner will need.

## Prove you’re free to get married

To prove you’re legally allowed to get married, you’ll need to either:

- go to the UK and [get a CNI](/marriage-abroad/y/italy/uk/opposite_sex)
- go to Italy and [get a Nulla Osta](/marriage-abroad/y/italy/ceremony_country/opposite_sex)

^Your partner will also need a CNI and statutory declaration or a Nulla Osta if they’re British. If they’re not, the documents they need might be different.^
