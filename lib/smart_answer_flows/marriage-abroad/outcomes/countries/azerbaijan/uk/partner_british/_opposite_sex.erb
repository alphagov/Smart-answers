##Before you start

Contact the [Embassy of Azerbaijan](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Azerbaijan](/foreign-travel-advice/azerbaijan) before making any plans.

##Prove you’re free to get married

You need to provide an affirmation document to prove you’re legally allowed to get married. 
It’s valid for 6 months.

You need to:

s1. Download an [affirmation](/government/publications/azerbaijan-affirmation-of-marital-status).
s2. Print it out but don’t sign it.
s3. [Make an appointment at the embassy in Baku](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-baku/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker) to sign it.


It costs £50 per person. You can pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/azerbaijan-consular-fees) in cash or with a credit card or debit card.

Your partner will also need an affirmation if they’re British. If they’re not, they might need an equivalent document.

###What you need to bring to your appointment

You’ll need to bring:

- your affirmation form
- your passport     
- your partner’s passport or ID     
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need:

- your [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering in email from the court) – if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) - if you’ve been widowed

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived or were a national of that country at the time of the divorce.^
If your documents aren’t in English or Azeri, you’ll need to bring [certified translations](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) as well as the originals.

##Getting married

You need to:

s1. Take your completed affirmation form (signed and stamped by the embassy) to the [Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)](http://www.mfa.gov.az/en) who will apostille the document.     
s2. Register the marriage using the [ASAN Service](http://www.asan.gov.az/en) or in person at the Palace of Happiness.
