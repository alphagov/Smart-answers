## Before you start

Contact the [local register office](https://www.mswia.gov.pl/pl/form/148,Adresy-USC-w-Polsce-Addresses-of-Civil-Registry-Offices.html) or church where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

## Prove you’re free to get married

You need to get a CNI to prove you’re legally allowed to get married.
 
If your partner is British, they’ll need to follow the same process to get their own CNI. If they’re not, the documents they need might be different.

### Get a CNI

To get a CNI, [make an appointment at the British Embassy in Warsaw](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-warsaw/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker) to give notice of your marriage. 
 
If you can’t get to the embassy, download and fill in the [notice of marriage](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form-poland) and [affidavit or affirmation for marriage](/government/publications/affidavitaffirmation-form-poland) and sign them in front of a [Polish notary](http://www.notaries-directory.eu/). You’ll have to pay a fee. Send the signed documents and supporting documents to the embassy.

You need to be in Poland for 3 full days before you can give notice. This means if you arrive on Monday you can’t give notice until Friday.
 
It costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:receiving_notice_of_marriage) %> to give notice and <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:issuing_cni_or_nulla_osta) %> for the CNI. You must complete a [payment form](/government/publications/credit-card-payment-authorisation-form-poland) and [email it to the embassy](mailto:Warsaw_consularmail@fco.gov.uk).

You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- [notice of marriage](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) and [affidavit or affirmation for marriage](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) - you can fill in (but not sign) these in advance
- proof that you live in or have been in Poland for at least 3 full days - for example a boarding pass or a utility bill with your Polish address
 
If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:
 
- your [original decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a printed PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed
 
^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll also need evidence that you or your former partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.^
 
You need to get your supporting documents (for example, a decree absolute) [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/publications/poland-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) if they’re not in English or Polish.
 
You’ll be charged fees for translating your documents.

The British embassy will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 full days. This means if the embassy gets your notice on Monday (in person or by post), it will be displayed until the following Tuesday. If nobody registers an objection, you can [book and appointment to collect your CNI from the embassy in Warsaw](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-warsaw/certificate-of-no-impediment/slot_picker) or ask for it it to be posted to an address in Poland.
 
You don’t need to stay in the country while your notice is displayed.

### If you’ve changed your name

If your name on any of your documents doesn’t appear exactly as it does on your birth certificate, you’ll need to provide evidence of your name change (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll). If you don’t, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead.

## Get married

Give your CNI to:
 
- the registrar at the register office if you’re having a civil ceremony - at least one month before your wedding
- the priest if you’re getting married in a church - at least 2 days before your wedding
 
You’ll also need to give them a [certified copy](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) of your birth certificate. They won’t give this back.

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:
 
- you follow the correct process according to the law in Poland
- it would be allowed under UK law
 
You won’t need to register your marriage in the UK.
 
If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
