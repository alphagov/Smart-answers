## Before you start

Contact the [local register office](https://www.mswia.gov.pl/pl/form/148,Adresy-USC-w-Polsce-Addresses-of-Civil-Registry-Offices.html) or church where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

## Prove you’re free to get married

You need to get a CNI in the UK to prove you’re legally allowed to get married. Ask the local register office in Poland if you need to exchange it for a Polish one.
 
If your partner is British, they’ll need to follow the same process to get their own CNI. If they’re not, the documents they need might be different.

### Get a CNI

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage. A CNI costs £35.
 
^Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)^
 
You’ll need to bring [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-to-take-to-the-register-office) with you to your appointment.
 
Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection.
 
If your CNI was issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, it will usually be valid at the town hall for 6 months. If it was issued in Scotland, it will expire after 3 months. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)
 
You’ll need to get your CNI [legalised](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO).
 
You’ll also need to get a certified translation of your CNI. Use an [approved translator](/government/publications/poland-list-of-translators-and-interpreters).
 
If the register office in Poland doesn’t accept UK-issued CNIs, [make an appointment at the British embassy in Warsaw](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-warsaw/certificate-of-no-impediment/slot_picker) to exchange it for a Poland-issued one. This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:issuing_cni_or_nulla_osta) %>.

### If you’ve changed your name

If your name on any of your documents doesn’t appear exactly as it does on your birth certificate, you’ll need to provide evidence of your name change (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll). If you don’t, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead.

## Get married

Give your CNI to:
 
- the registrar at the town hall if you’re having a civil ceremony - at least one month before your wedding
- the priest if you’re getting married in a church - at least 2 days before your wedding
 
You’ll also need to give them a [certified copy](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) of your birth certificate. They won’t give this back.

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:
 
- you follow the correct process according to the law in Poland
- it would be allowed under UK law
 
You won’t need to register your marriage in the UK.
 
If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
