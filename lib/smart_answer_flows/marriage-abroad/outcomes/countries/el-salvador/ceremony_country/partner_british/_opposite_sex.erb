Contact the relevant local authorities in El Salvador to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in El Salvador. You can do this at the British Honorary Consulate or in front of a notary public.

You’ll need to have been living in El Salvador for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, for example if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

[Email the British Honorary Consulate in San Salvador](mailto:George.Chippendale-HonCon@fconet.fco.gov.uk) to request an appointment. The Honorary Consul’s office will confirm your appointment within 24 hours.

[Email the Honorary Consul](mailto:George.Chippendale-HonCon@fconet.fco.gov.uk) if you need to cancel or change your appointment.

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the Honorary Consulate to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner

You’ll need to complete a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form and an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.^

###What happens next

The Honorary Consulate will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in El Salvador.

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^
