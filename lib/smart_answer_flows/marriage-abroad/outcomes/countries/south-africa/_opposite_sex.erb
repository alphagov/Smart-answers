#Marriage in South Africa

##Before you start

Contact the local authorities in South Africa to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^ You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for South Africa](foreign-travel-advice/south-africa) before making any plans.
 
##Prove you’re free to get married

The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. 

You can get a letter to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Book an appointment to collect the letter at the [British Consulate General in Cape Town](/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-cape-town) or the [British High Commission in Pretoria](/world/organisations/british-high-commission-pretoria). The letter is free. If you can’t go to an appointment, you can ask a friend or family member to make an appointment and collect it for you.

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in South Africa 
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

*[CNI]: certificates of no impediment
