  Contact the register office ("Matrika") where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

  <%= render partial: 'what_you_need_to_do.govspeak.erb' %>

  The Matrika will ask you to provide an [affirmation of marital status](/government/publications/affirmation-of-marital-status-in-slovakia-examples), signed by a local notary public in Slovakia, to prove you’re allowed to get married.

  They’ll probably ask you for one or more documents issued in the UK, eg a birth certificate, death certificate or divorce documents.

  ### Legalisation and translation

  UK-issued documents need to be:

  - '[legalised](/get-document-legalised)' (certified as genuine)
  - translated - [find a translator in Slovakia](/government/publications/slovakia-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) or ask for a list of translators at the Matrika
