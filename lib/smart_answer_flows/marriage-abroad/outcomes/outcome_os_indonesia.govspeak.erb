<% content_for :body do %>
  Make an appointment at the British Embassy in Jakarta to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry.

  Before the appointment you’ll need to pay a fee to the British Embassy in Jakarta. You can do this by credit card or in cash in the local currency. You also need to complete 2 copies of the [‘Affidavit for marriage’ form](/government/publications/marriage-in-indonesia).

  Send one copy to the British Embassy in Jakarta by email or post. Take the other one with you when you go to your local appointment, along with your passport.

  ^Allow the embassy at least 2 days to process your paperwork before turning up for your appointment.^
