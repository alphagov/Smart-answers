###No trace letters

The Danish authorities will sometimes accept a ‘no trace letter’ instead of a CNI. Check with the Danish authorities to find out if they’ll accept a ‘no trace letter’.

You can get a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office. Ask them to make a search and quote reference ‘SEARCH 123’.
