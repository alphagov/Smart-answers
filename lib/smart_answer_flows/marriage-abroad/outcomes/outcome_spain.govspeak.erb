    Check with the civil registry  where you’re getting married to find out what certificate you’ll need.

    There are 2 ways you can get these certificates:

    - [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](<%= uk_residence_outcome_path %>)
    - [go to <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %> and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](<%= ceremony_country_residence_outcome_path %>)

    You need to apply for all certificates at least 3 months before the date you intend to get married.

    You must be physically present in Spain for at least 3 days before you apply for a CNI.

    ^Document requirements vary across Spain - check with the [civil registry](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC) where you’re getting married to find out what you’ll need.^
