  ##What you need to do

  At your appointment the embassy will give you:

  -  a notice of registration
  -  a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry or enter into a civil partnership

  Once you’ve completed these and paid the registration fee, the <%= calculator.diplomatic_mission %> will display your notice publicly for 14 days.
