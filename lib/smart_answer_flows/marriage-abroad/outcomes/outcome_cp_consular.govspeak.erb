  ##What documents you’ll need

  You’ll need proof that you’ve been resident in the area covered by the <%= institution_name %> for at least 7 days, like an employer’s letter or a bank statement.


  You’ll both need your original passports. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

  - a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order), or
  - the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

  <% if calculator.partner_nationality != 'partner_british' %>
    Your partner will also need either:

    - a ‘certificate of no impediment’ (CNI) or similar document to prove they’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership from their national authorities
    - an official letter from the local authorities in the country where they’re resident confirming that they’re single

    ^Any foreign documents may need to be ’[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) in the country they were issued (or that country’s embassy in <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %>), and [translated into English](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers).^

  <% end %>

  ###What you need to do

  Once you’ve made your appointment, the <%= institution_name %> will give you:

  - a notice of registration
  - a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to enter into a civil partnership

  Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee (see below), the <%= institution_name %> will display your notice publicly for 14 days.

  As long as nobody has registered an objection after this time, the registration officer can then register your partnership any time until 3 months after the date you gave notice.

  You’ll need to provide two witnesses and pay a fee to register your civil partnership. You’ll need to pay an additional fee for your civil partnership certificate (see below).
