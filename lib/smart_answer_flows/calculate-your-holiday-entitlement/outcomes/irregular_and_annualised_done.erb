  The statutory holiday entitlement is <%= calculator.formatted_full_time_part_time_weeks %> weeks holiday.

  There are no regulations on how to convert the entitlement into days or hours for workers with irregular hours.

  You may wish to [use the calculator again](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement/y) and calculate the average days or hours worked each week based on a representative reference period instead.

  <% calculator.irregular_and_annualised.each do |part| %>
    <%= render partial: part %>
