  Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the flat rate of £<%= flat_rate_amount %> per week. This is an estimate. The exact amount the Child Maintenance Service calculates may be different.

  This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.

  <% if calculator.paying? %>
    Depending on how child maintenance is arranged, fees may be added to this amount.
