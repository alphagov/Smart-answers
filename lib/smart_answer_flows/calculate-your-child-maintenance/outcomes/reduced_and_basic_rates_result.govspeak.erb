  Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the <%= calculator.rate_type.to_s.humanize(capitalize: false) %> rate of £<%= child_maintenance_payment %> per week.

  ^This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.^

  <%= render partial: 'calculate-your-child-maintenance/disclaimer.govspeak.erb' %>
