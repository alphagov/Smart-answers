  You can tow trailers up to 750kg with a standard C1 medium-sized vehicle licence as long as the vehicle weight is not more than 7,500kg..

  If you want to tow heavier trailers you’ll need to pass the C1+E test.

  This lets you have a restricted C1+E entitlement because you’re under 21. It lets you tow trailers heavier than 750kg as long as the combined vehicle and trailer weight is not more than 7,500kg.

  Once you’re 21 you’ll automatically get the full C1+E entitlement and you can tow combinations up to 12,000kg. The fully-loaded trailer cannot weigh more than the unladen vehicle.
