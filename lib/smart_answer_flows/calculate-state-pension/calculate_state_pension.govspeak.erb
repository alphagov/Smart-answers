  Calculate when you’ll reach State Pension age, Pension Credit qualifying age or fine out when you'll be eligible for free bus travel.

  Get a [State Pension Statement](/state-pension-statement) instead of using this calculator if:
  
  - you're 55 or over
  - you're making a financial decision based on [the new pension options](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/)

  ##What you need to know:

  This calculator gives an estimate of your basic State pension and information about the [new State Pension](/new-state-pension).

  It doesn’t estimate any [Additional State Pension.](/additional-state-pension)

  You’ll be asked for the number of years you worked and paid National Insurance or got certain benefits. These are the years of your [National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance) that count towards your State Pension.

  Count tax years from 6 April to 5 April and don’t count any years twice (eg when you were working and getting benefits). Don’t count the current tax year.

  This calculator uses a simplified calculation based on the current law. It can’t take into account every circumstance that might affect you. Don't make future financial decisions based on its results.
