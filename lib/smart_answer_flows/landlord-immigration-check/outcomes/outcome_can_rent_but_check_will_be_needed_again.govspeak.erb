  This person can currently rent the property.

  You need to make a copy of the [relevant parts of the documents](/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents).

  You'll have to make this check again in either: 
  
  - 12 month's time (if their right to stay runs out before that) 
  - when their right to stay in the UK runs out (if it's longer than 12 months)
