If you disagree with the tribunal's decision, you can ask to have it cancelled (set aside) if:

* you didn&apos;t get an important document about the hearing in time

If you think they made a mistake in the law, you can ask for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

You might have longer to decide about appealing depending on:

* when the benefits office sent it to you

If you&apos;re not sure when you asked for the written statement, your benefits office will be able to tell you. Contact them using the details on your decision letter.

You normally have 1 month after you got the decision to start an appeal, but you might
be able to ask for more time.

Contact the benefits office using the details on your decision letter if you couldn&apos;t
appeal because you were:

* in hospital or coping with illness
* coping with bereavement
* outside the UK
* couldn&apos;t send your appeal form (eg if there was a postal strike)
* affected by something else that meant you couldnâ€™t appeal within a month

You might be able to:

- make a late appeal
- make a late request for the decision to be looked at again

  title "Have you asked the benefits office to look at the decision again?"
  body <<-EndBody
Sometimes, the benefits office will change a decision about your benefits if you ask them to look at it again (reconsider).

You don&apos;t have to ask them to reconsider before you appeal. If you don't think you'll have enough time before the deadline, you might want to skip this stage and start an appeal straight away.
