$!You must register the death according to the regulations in <%= death_country_name_lowercase_prefix %>. You will be given a local death certificate.$!

This local death certificate will be accepted in the UK (it may need to be a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document) of the document if it’s not in English).

##Register the death with the UK authorities
