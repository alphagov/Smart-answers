# The husband, wife or civil partner keeps all the assets (including property) up to Â£450,000, and all the personal possessions, whatever their value.

They also get half the amount left over.

The remainder is divided between the surviving siblings.

If a brother or sister has already died, their children (nieces and nephews of the deceased) inherit in their place.
