# The husband, wife or civil partner keeps all the assets (including property), up to Â£250,000, and all the personal possessions, whatever their value.

The husband, wife or civil partner must survive the deceased by at least 28 days to inherit.

They also get one third of the rest of the estate.

The remaining two-thirds are shared between their children.

If a son or daughter has already died, their children (the grandchildren of the deceased) will inherit in their place.
