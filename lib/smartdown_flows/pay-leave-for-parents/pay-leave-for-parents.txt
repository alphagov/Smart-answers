# Calculate your leave and pay when you have a child

Find out:

* if you can get maternity, paternity or shared parental leave
* how much pay you can get if you take leave

## Before you start

You’ll need to know:

* your employment status (eg employed or worker)
* the date you started your current job
* the date you finished work (if you’ve finished)
* how much you earn
* when you want your leave to start
* how much leave you want to take

^ You’ll need the same information about your partner if you plan to share the care of the child with them.^
