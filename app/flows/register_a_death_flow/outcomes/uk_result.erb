You’ll be contacted by the medical examiner’s office to confirm you can register the death.

You must register the death within 5 days (8 days in Scotland) of being contacted. This includes weekends and bank holidays.

  Contact a [register office](/register-offices) to register the death. You can contact any register office but it will be quicker if you use the one in the area where the person died.

  Who should register the death
  --------

  A relative should register the death. 
  
  If a relative cannot register the death, you can do it if you:


  <% if calculator.died_at_home_or_in_hospital? %>
    - were there at the time of death
    - are an administrator from the hospital (if the person died in hospital)
    - are in charge of making funeral arrangements

  <% else %>
    - were there at the time of death
    - are the person who found the body
    - are the person in charge of the body
    - are in charge of making funeral arrangements
  <% end %>

    If the cause of death is unknown, sudden or unexplained it may be reported to the coroner.

    The coroner will give you the documents you need, or they’ll send them direct to the registrar. The table below shows the documents needed.

    Cause of death | Documents issued by coroner
    - | -
    Natural causes | Form 100A, or Pink Form 100B if there's a post-mortem - these forms are sent to the  registrar, but sometimes given to you
    Unnatural causes/not enough evidence of natural causes | Order for Burial (form 101) or Certificate for Cremation (form 6) so the funeral can take place – will be given to you; Certificate After Inquest (form 99 (rev)) - this states the cause of death and is sent to the registrar (the death is registered by the registrar with no-one present)

    ###If form 100A or 100B is issued (ie there is no inquest)

    The register office may also want to see the person’s:

    - birth certificate
    - marriage or civil partnership certificate
    - NHS medical card
  
  Ask the register office what to do if you do not have them.
