<% govspeak_for :body do %>
  The last day of leave the employee will be eligible for statutory paternity pay is <%= calculator.paternity_deadline.strftime("%d %B %Y") %>.
  If their leave falls outside this period, this calculator may not be accurate and you'll need to use your payroll software or [calculate payments manually](/guidance/statutory-paternity-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments).
