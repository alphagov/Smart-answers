  ##If you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 8 October 2024

  You may be able to use your [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/guidance/apply-for-an-electronic-travel-authorisation-eta) to stay in the UK if you already have one.

  All of the following must apply:

  * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 10 September 2024
  * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 8 October 2024
  * you meet the [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) eligibility requirements

  An ETA lets you stay in the UK for up to 6 months.

  ###If you need to leave and re-enter the UK

  You cannot use your ETA to re-enter the UK if either of the following apply:



  * you did not book your return journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 10 September 2024

  * you’re returning to the UK on or after 3pm (UK time) on 8 October 2024

  You’ll usually need a Standard Visitor visa or permission to stay as a ‘dependant’ of your family member’s visa category instead.
