  You can stay in the UK for up to 6 months without a visa, but you must meet the [Standard Visitor eligibility requirements](/standard-visitor).

  [Check what documents you need to bring](/government/publications/visitor-visa-guide-to-supporting-documents) to show officers at the UK border.

  The rules on what you’ll need to enter the UK may be different if you’re [travelling from Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man](/guidance/travelling-between-the-uk-and-ireland-isle-of-man-guernsey-or-jersey).

  %If you have a criminal record or you’ve previously been refused entry into the UK, you may want to [apply for a Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor/apply-standard-visitor-visa).%

  ##If you’re staying more than 6 months

  You can apply for a [Parent of a Child Student visa](/parent-of-a-child-at-school-visa) if your child is under 12 and at an independent day school.
