You can stay in the UK for up to 6 months without a visa, but you must meet the [Standard Visitor eligibility requirements](/standard-visitor).

[Check what documents you need to bring](/standard-visitor/visit-for-medical-reasons) to show officers at the UK border.

^The rules on what you’ll need to enter the UK may be different if you’re [travelling from Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man](/guidance/travelling-between-the-uk-and-ireland-isle-of-man-guernsey-or-jersey).

##If your treatment will last longer than 6 months

You must apply for a Standard Visitor visa for medical treatment lasting longer than 6 months.

You can:

* [apply for a Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor/apply-standard-visitor-visa) before you come to the UK - this lasts for up to 11 months and costs £190
* visit for up to 6 months and [apply to stay for a further 6 months when you’re in the UK](/standard-visitor/extend-your-stay) for a fee of £993

There is no limit on how many times you can extend your stay. It costs £993 each time you do.

Depending on where you come from, you may also need a certificate that proves you do not have tuberculosis (TB). [Check if you’ll need to take a TB test](/tb-test-visa).
