  ##What you can and cannot do without a visa

  You can come to the UK as a Standard Visitor for up to 6 months without a visa if you’re doing certain activities, such as:

  * going to meetings or conferences
  * doing academic research
  * doing certain paid engagements or events (a ‘permitted paid engagement’) for UK-based organisations

  You cannot:

  * do other paid or unpaid work for a UK company or as a self-employed person
  * do a work placement or internship
  * sell directly to the public or provide goods and services

  If you’re doing a permitted paid engagement, you must do it within one month of arriving. You can stay in the UK for up to 6 months, but cannot do any paid engagements after the first month.
