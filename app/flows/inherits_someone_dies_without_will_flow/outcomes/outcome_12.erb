  [Find legal advice](/find-legal-advice/find-legal-adviser) to help you figure out the net value of the estate and who will inherit what, as this is legally complex.

  ##If the estate is worth up to £250,000

  The husband, wife or civil partner gets all of the estate and are entitled to apply for probate.

  If the husband, wife or civil partner died after the deceased, their share will become part of their own estate.

  ##If the estate is worth over £250,000

  The estate will be divided between the husband, wife or civil partner and the children of the deceased.

  The husband, wife or civil partner and is entitled to apply for probate and gets:

  - up to £250,000 in assets, and half of the rest of the estate
  - all of the personal possessions of the deceased

  The children of the deceased are entitled to a share of the half of the estate above £250,000.

  If any of the children died before the deceased, their children (grandchildren of the deceased) will inherit in their place.

  If any of these grandchildren died before the deceased, their children (great-grandchildren of the deceased) will inherit in their place.

  If any of these people died after the deceased, their share will become part of their own estate.
