    If an aunt or uncle died before the deceased, their children (the cousins of the deceased) inherit in their place.

    If any of these cousins died before the deceased, their children will inherit in their place and they are entitled to [apply for probate](/applying-for-probate/apply-for-probate).

    If any aunts, uncles or their descendants died after the deceased, their share will become part of their own estate.
