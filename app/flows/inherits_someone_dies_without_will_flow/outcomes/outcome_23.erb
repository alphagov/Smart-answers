    If a half-brother or half-sister died before the deceased, their children (half-nieces and half-nephews of the deceased) will inherit in their place.

    If any of these half-nieces or half-nephews died before the deceased, their children will inherit in their place and they are entitled to [apply for probate](/applying-for-probate/apply-for-probate).

    If any half-brothers, half-sisters or their descendants died after the deceased, their share will become part of their own estate.
