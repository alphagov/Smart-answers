    If a half-aunt or half-uncle died before the deceased, their children (the half-cousins of the deceased) inherit in their place.

    If any of these half-cousins died before the deceased, their children will inherit in their place and they are entitled to [apply for probate](/applying-for-probate/apply-for-probate).

    If any half-aunts, half-uncles or their descendants died after the deceased, their share will become part of their own estate.
