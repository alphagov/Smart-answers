    ##If you submit a new Child Benefit claim between 6 April and 7 July 2024

    Your claim may be backdated by up to 3 months.

    If you’re submitting a Self Assessment tax return for 2024 to 2025, you’ll need to add the Child Benefit figure from 2023 to 2024 to this year’s figure (<%= number_to_currency calculator.benefits_claimed_amount, unit: "£", precision: 2  %>).

    To work out the 2023 to 2024 Child Benefit figure, use the Child Benefit calculator and enter your income for that year. You can ignore the tax charge for 2023 to 2024 if there is one.

    Use the combined figure in your 2024 to 2025 Self Assessment tax return.

    ^If your income from 2023 to 2024 was a lot higher, your 2024 to 2025 tax charge may go up when you add the 2 Child Benefit figures together. If this happens, you can choose to submit separate tax returns for each tax year instead.
  <% elsif calculator.tax_year == "2023" %>
    ##If you submit a new Child Benefit claim between 6 April and 7 July 2024

    If you’re calculating your backdated amount, you do not need to send a separate Self Assessment tax return for 2023 to 2024. Add the Child Benefit amount to your 2024 to 2025 Child Benefit tax calculator result.

    The calculator includes the most common sources of income and
    allowable deductions. If you think you have income or deductions that
    are not on the calculator, phone the
    [Income Tax helpline](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees)
    to find out if you have to pay the tax charge.

    ## How and when to pay

    You need to pay a [tax charge on the Child Benefit](/child-benefit-tax-charge) you’ve claimed.

    To pay the charge you must fill in a Self Assessment tax return each tax year. Follow these steps:

    - [Register for Self Assessment](/register-for-self-assessment) if you don’t already fill in a tax return - you should do this by <%= calculator.sa_register_deadline %>.
    - Fill in the tax return and include the amount of Child Benefit received for the tax year.
    - Send the tax return.
    - Pay the tax you owe.

    There are [deadlines](/self-assessment-tax-return-deadlines) for sending the tax return and paying the tax.

    The person with the highest income pays the tax charge, so use your partner’s income in the calculator if it’s higher than yours.

    ## Your Child Benefit
    You can choose to:

    - [stop getting Child Benefit](/child-benefit-tax-charge/stop-child-benefit) - you must pay any tax you owe
    - carry on getting Child Benefit - for each tax year you get it you must fill in a tax return and pay any tax you owe

    <% if calculator.tax_year == "2012" %>
      Your result for the next tax year may be higher because the tax charge will apply to the whole tax year (and not just 7 January to 5 April 2013).
