  The last date you can pay is <%= calculator.last_payment_date.to_fs(:govuk_date) %>.

  HMRC must receive the money by <%= calculator.funds_received_by.to_fs(:govuk_date) %>.

  You need your VAT registration number as the payment reference.

  CHAPS payments usually reach HMRC the same working day if you pay within your bank’s processing times.

  ^Check your bank’s transaction limits and processing times before making a payment.^
