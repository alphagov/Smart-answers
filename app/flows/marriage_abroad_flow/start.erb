If youâ€™re a British national getting a marriage or civil partnership abroad, you might need certain documents from the UK government, for example a certificate of no impediment (CNI).

Use this tool to find out how to get the documents you'll need.

You'll need to contact the local authorities where you want to get married to find out what you need to do.

Your marriage or civil partnership will be recognised in the UK if both of the following apply:

- you followed the correct process in the country where you got married
- it would be allowed [under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

*[CNI]: certificate of no impediment

  If you're unable to get married or register a civil partnership in your chosen country, it might be possible at a British embassy, consulate or high commission instead. This is known as a 'consular marriage' or 'consular civil partnership'.

  Check which countries offer [consular marriage](/guidance/getting-married-at-a-british-embassy-high-commission-or-consulate) and [consular civil partnership](/guidance/registering-a-civil-partnership-at-a-british-embassy-high-commission-or-consulate) and the processes you'll need to follow.
