Contact the [Embassy of Brazil](https://www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/assuntos/Embaixadas-Consulados-Missoes/do-brasil-no-exterior) in the country you’re in to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Brazil](/foreign-travel-advice/brazil) before making any plans.

You might be able to form an opposite sex civil partnership. Check the local rules with the Embassy of Brazil in the country you are in.

## What you need to do

You’ll need to provide evidence that you’re allowed to marry. 

Contact the local authorities in the country you’re in to check if they can provide the relevant documents. If you cannot get the documents from the country you’re in, you can either:

* go to the UK and get a certificate of no impediment (CNI)
* go to Brazil and make an affirmation or affidavit of marital status at a British embassy 

### Get a CNI in the UK

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local:

* [register office in England and Wales](/register-offices)
* [register office in Scotland (PDF, 64KB)](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf)
* [register office in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/district-registrars-northern-ireland)
* [register office in the Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages)
* [register office in Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71)
* [register office in Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You’ll need to check with the local authorities in Brazil to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

For your CNI to be valid in Brazil, you'll need to: 

- [get your CNI 'legalised'](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) in the UK
- [get your CNI translated by a sworn translator in Brazil](/government/publications/brazil-list-of-lawyers)

Check with the local authorities in Brazil to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

### Make an affirmation of marital status in Brazil

Book an appointment at the nearest British embassy or consulate in Brazil to make an affirmation or affidavit of marital status. You can:

* [book an appointment at the British Embassy Brasilia](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=105&service=13)  
* [book an appointment at the British Consulate-General Sao Paulo](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=76&service=13)  
* [book an appointment at the British Consulate-General Rio de Janeiro](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=59&service=13)  

When you go to your appointment you need to bring:

* the oath, affirmation or affidavit that you will swear or affirm (the embassy will send this to you after you book your appointment)
* the [fee for administering an oath, declaration or affirmation](/government/publications/brazil-consular-fees) (you normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency)
* your British passport

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK (you’ll need to [get it translated into English](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters)) 
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll
