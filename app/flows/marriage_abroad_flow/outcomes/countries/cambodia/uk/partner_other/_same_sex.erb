You may be able to register a civil partnership or get married at the British embassy or consulate in Cambodia.

You must post notice of your marriage at the British embassy in Phnom Penh.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Phnom Penh.](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=135&service=13)

##What documents you’ll need

You’ll both need to bring proof that you’ve been resident in Cambodia for the last 7 days.

You’ll both need to bring your original passports. You’ll also need evidence that your partner is free to marry - a document from their government or their passport that says they are unmarried. 

### If you've been married or in a civil partnership before

You’ll also need to provide the original document of:

* your decree absolute or final order (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
* your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
* your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
* your partner’s death certificate and your marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

If you’ve been widowed and your partner died abroad you can use the death certificate from the country where your partner died. If the death is also registered in the UK you can use the UK death certificate instead. 

###If you do not have the original documents

You can provide copies of your documents if you do not have the originals. 

If your marriage or partnership ended, or your partner died, in the UK you can use:

* [a copy of the divorce, annulment or dissolution document](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
* a copy of your partner's death certificate and your marriage certificate

[Order a copy of a birth, death or marriage certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate).

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in, or were a national of that country, at the time.

The copies of your documents must be signed by a solicitor or notary in the country where your marriage or civil partnership ended or where your partner died. 

Your supporting documents need to be in English or Khmer (the official language of Cambodia). You must provide professional translations if the documents are in another language. You can use any qualified translator or find one on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) [list of translators and interpreters in Cambodia](/government/publications/cambodia-list-of-translators-and-interpreters/list-of-translators-and-interpreters-in-cambodia).

At your appointment the embassy or consulate will give you:

-  a notice of registration
-  a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry or enter into a civil partnership

Once you’ve completed these and paid the registration fee, the embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.

As long as nobody registers an objection you can get married or enter into a civil partnership up to 3 months after you gave notice.

You’ll need to bring two witnesses to your ceremony - they’ll need to show their photo ID (for example passport or driver’s licence).

You’ll need to pay a fee to register your marriage or civil partnership and a fee for your marriage or civil partnership certificate.

^All same-sex marriages must take place under English and Welsh or Scottish law even if you live in or are from Northern Ireland. Tell the embassy or consulate which law you want to get married under at your appointment.^
