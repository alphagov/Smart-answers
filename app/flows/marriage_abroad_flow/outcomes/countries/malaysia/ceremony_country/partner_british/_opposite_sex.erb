Contact the relevant local authorities in Malaysia to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

The UK does not issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

The British High Commission in Malaysia can provide you with a letter explaining this position for a charge - see [consular fees for Malaysia](/government/publications/malaysia-consular-fees).

[Make an appointment at the High Commission in Kuala Lumpur](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=176&service=19) to get your letter.

You’ll need to provide the following documents:

- a statutory declaration made at the office of a notary public or a commissioner for oaths in the [UK](https://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/) or [Malaysia](https://epjs.kehakiman.gov.my/) - the document you'll need depends on whether you are [single](/government/publications/malaysia-statutory-declaration-for-marriage-single), [divorced](/government/publications/malaysia-statutory-declaration-for-marriage-divorced) or [widowed](/government/publications/malaysia-statutory-declaration-for-marriage-if-you-are-widowed)
- your original passport and your partner’s passport
- a divorce certificate (if you have been previously married)
- a death certificate (if you are widowed)
- proof of address

^You must get married through an Islamic ceremony in Malaysia if you or your partner is a Muslim. Otherwise, you’ll need to have a civil marriage.^
