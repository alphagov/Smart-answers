- a statutory declaration made at the office of a notary public or a commissioner for oaths in the [UK](https://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/) or [Malaysia](https://epjs.kehakiman.gov.my/) - the document you'll need depends on whether you are [single](/government/publications/malaysia-statutory-declaration-for-marriage-single), [divorced](/government/publications/malaysia-statutory-declaration-for-marriage-divorced) or [widowed](/government/publications/malaysia-statutory-declaration-for-marriage-if-you-are-widowed)
