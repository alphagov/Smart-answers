## Before you start

Contact a Moroccan marriage office (Laadoul) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you'll need.

^Check the [travel advice for Morocco](/foreign-travel-advice/morocco) and [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

## What you need to do

To prove you can legally get married, you will need to:

- apply for an affirmation of marital status (this is official proof that you're free to get married)
- book an appointment to swear the affirmation at the British Embassy in Rabat or the British Honorary Consulate in Marrakech
- get your affirmation 'legalised' (certified as genuine), then translated into the local language
- get a certified copy of your passport

You will need to get married within 3 months of the date you swear your affirmation.

## Apply for an affirmation of marital status

You can apply for an affirmation online or in person. You'll need to get your passport certified as part of your application. This costs £25 per person.

### Apply for an affirmation of marital status online

You need to bring an affirmation to your appointment at the embassy or honorary consulate.

You can only apply online if you have a UK passport.

You can pay the £50 fee either:

- online as you apply
- in cash using the [local currency](/government/publications/fco-consular-services-abroad-exchange-rates) when you go for your embassy appointment

You'll need:

- a photo of your UK passport
- a photo of your partner's Moroccan passport or national identity card
- a debit or credit card, if you want to pay online

You'll be told if you need to provide any other documents. For example, if you've been married before you'll need proof that the marriage is over.

You'll be told how to book an appointment to swear your affirmation.

## Translate and legalise your affirmation

After your appointment at the embassy or consulate, you need to get your affirmation both:

- 'legalised' (certified as genuine) by the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Morocco](https://www.consulat.ma/en/legalization-ministry-foreign-affairs-and-international-cooperation)
- [translated into Arabic](/government/publications/morocco-translators-and-interpreters)

## Get married

You should take your affirmation to the Moroccan family courts where you're getting married.

The registrar will marry you and give you a marriage certificate.

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Morocco
- it would be allowed under UK law

You do not need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/british-citizenship/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they've lived in the UK for 3 years.
