Contact the relevant local authorities in Bulgaria to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and give notice at a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/bulgaria/uk/partner_local/opposite_sex)
- [go to Bulgaria and give notice at a notary public there](/marriage-abroad/y/bulgaria/ceremony_country/partner_local/opposite_sex)

If you give notice in the UK, you’ll normally have to wait at least 38 days to get your CNI.

If you give notice in Bulgaria, you’ll normally have to wait at least 13 days to get your CNI. It can take longer depending on the local authorities’ processes and the time of year.
