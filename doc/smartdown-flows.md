# DEPRECATED: Smartdown Smart Answers

**Smartdown flows have been deprecated. This is here for reference until we get rid of them completely.**

Smartdown flows are stored in `lib/smartdown_flows`.

The code responsible for executing the flow of those questions is in the [smartdown gem](https://github.com/alphagov/smartdown).

### Testing Smartdown flows

Smartdown flows are tested using [scenarios][smartdown-scenarios] in the flow directories.

These tests go through all the scenarios defined for the Smartdown Smart Answer and:

- checks each set of questions has been asked in the right order
- checks the right outcome has been reached given the answers

Test all Smartdown flows by running:

    bundle exec ruby -Itest test/unit/smartdown_content/smartdown_scenarios_test.rb

Test a single Smartdown flow by running:

     SMARTDOWN_FLOW_TO_TEST=<name-of-smartdown-flow> \
     bundle exec ruby -Itest test/unit/smartdown_content/smartdown_scenarios_test.rb

## Pay and leave for parents

Three tools specific to the pay and leave for parents tool were developed to facilitate question writing and fact-checking.

### Outcome generation

```rake smartdown_generate_outcomes:pay_leave_for_parents```

This command goes through all the outcomes listed in the Pay and leave for parents questions and generates outcome files that
are prepopulated with snippets.
For the pay and leave for parents, we use the convention of naming each outcome as an `_`-separated string of all snippets to be listed for that outcome.

### Factcheck table generation

```rake smartdown_generate_factcheck:pay_leave_for_parents```

#### Output of the tool

This rake task builds four markdown documents and saves them to the ```smart-answers-factcheck``` project.
Those four markdown documents summarise the question outcomes for:
* Birth cases before 05/04/2015
* Birth cases after 05/04/2015

Each markdown document is a table summarising the answers given to each question and listing what types of maternity,
paternity, adoption, shared parental leave and pay the user(s) is/are eligible for given their answer.

#### How possible combinations are generated

We have chosen for each question in the pay and leave for parents a selection of answers that can affect the outcome of the tool.
This is not an exhaustive list of possible answers. As the tool evolves and more legal rules are added, **possible answers
that can affect the outcome of the flow should be added to the combinations to have an accurate and complete factcheck table**.

### Factcheck diff

```rake smartdown_generate_factcheck:diff_pay_leave_for_parents```

#### Output of the tool

This rake task builds the factcheck table for the current state of the pay leave for parents smartdown flows
and generates a diff of the factcheck tables currently in the smart-answers-factcheck project. This rake task should be used
to ensure that when modifying the flow, outcomes are not accidentally changed in areas of the flow not meant to be modified.

### Smartdown Plugins

Each smartdown flow can have an optional smartdown plugin. These plugins provide helper methods that are used in the generation of smartdown questions and answers. Smartdown plugins are located within lib/smartdown_plugins/*flow_name*/
Currently there are two types of smartdown plugins. render_time.rb and build_time.rb.

lib/smartdown_plugins/*flow_name*/
  - render_time.rb
  - build_time.rb

#### Shared Plugins
smartdown plugins also have access to a communal set of shared functions. These shared functions are located within lib/smartdown_plugins/shared/. To use a shared plugin, extend it in your flow-specific plugin: like so

````
module SmartdownPlugins
  module ExampleFlowPlugin
    extend SharedPlugin
    .
    .
    .
  end
end
````

#### Render Time

Render time smartdown plugins are intended to be used to store functions that will be passed a users answers to question as the arguments. You could use them to render templates, perform calculations or make external HTTP requests to a data source.

#### Build Time

Build time smartdown plugins contain methods that are available to smartdown in the parsing/building process. This means that they do not take any arguments - ie. they are just used as
a way of injecting data to the build step, often in the form of a ruby hash.

#### Data Partials

Will render an erb template that is located within lib/smart_answer_flows/data_partials. It accepts locals that are passed to the template.

Example usage:

````
require 'uri'

module FlowIdentifierName
  extend DataPartial

  def self.data_embassy(country_name)
    location = open("http://example.com/countries/#{country_name}.json")
    render 'data_partial_name', locals: {location: location}
  end

end
````
