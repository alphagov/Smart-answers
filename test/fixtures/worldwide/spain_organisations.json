Visitors are required to pass through a number of security checks where such items will be detected.</p>\n\n<p>Weapons (including pepper sprays), or any object that our security staff consider could be used as a weapon (scissors, screwdrivers, small blades), are also forbidden. These will not be retained by our staff. Should you arrive with such an object you will not be granted access but will be asked to return without it.  </p>\n\n<p>These regulations are intended to help us ensure the security for our staff and visitors. Your co-operation is appreciated. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"parking\">Parking</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately there is no public parking in Torre Espacio itself.
