Taiwan is the world\u2019s eighteenth largest trading economy. Its high-technology strengths and ongoing national investment programmes present benefits for UK companies. ","description":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>Taiwan is also an excellent springboard into China for UK companies, as the market here is more developed and Taiwanese business has longstanding expertise working in China (Taiwan was second only to Hong Kong as China\u2019s fourth largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2012, with over 57% of China\u2019s total FDI, and there are around 80,000 Taiwanese companies located in China, accounting for 70% of China\u2019s electronics manufacturing). </p>\n\n<p>UK companies have worked with Taiwanese partners to access the Chinese market. The UK is seen by Taiwan as a world leader in the creative industries, and cultural and educational links are thickening. (30% of all Taiwanese who study overseas do so in the UK). Following the 2009 lifting of the visa regime for visits of under 6 months, Taiwanese tourism to the UK has risen sharply. </p>\n\n<p>One of the British Trade &amp; Cultural Office\u2019s (BTCO\u2019s) main aims is to increase business relationships between the UK and Taiwan, working in partnership with UK Trade &amp; Investment. The BTCO is publicises commercial opportunities through supporting and organising targeted events and visits. </p>\n\n<p>There are approximately 300 UK companies located in Taiwan, across a variety of sectors. These include financial and business services, ICT, telecommunications, infrastructure, environmental technology, creative industries and marine industries. </p>\n\n<p>Likewise, Taiwanese companies are realising the benefits of setting up in the UK, where they can source the world\u2019s best talent, products, services and technology. Currently over 180 Taiwanese companies have a presence in the UK and are using it as their base for global growth.</p></div>","services":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><h2 id=\"visashttpwwwukbahomeofficegovukcountriestaiwanlangnameuk20english-uk-border-agency-website\"><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/countries/taiwan/?langname=UK%20English\" title=\"UK Border Agency website\">Visas</a></h2>\n<p>For information on whether you require a visa for the United Kingdom and how to apply go to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/countries/taiwan/?langname=UK%20English\" title=\"UK Border Agency website\">UK Border Agency website</a> </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"births-deaths-and-marriageshttpswwwgovukbrowsebirths-deaths-marriages-births-deaths-and-marriages\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/browse/births-deaths-marriages/\" title=\"Births, deaths and marriages\">Births, deaths and marriages</a></h2>\n<p>Information on how you can register a birth or death which occurred overseas, and legal documents for couples marrying or entering into civil partnerships abroad. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passports-and-emergency-travel-documentshttpswwwgovukoverseas-passports-passports-and-emergency-travel-documents\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports/\" title=\"Passports and emergency travel documents\">Passports and emergency travel documents</a></h2>\n<p>How to renew or replace your British passport when outside of the UK and information on getting replacement travel documents if your passport is lost or stolen. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-advicehttpswwwgovukforeign-travel-advicetaiwan-travel-advice\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/taiwan/\" title=\"Travel advice\">Travel advice</a></h2>\n<p>Information on staying safe and avoiding problems when living or travelling abroad, with links to our embassies, high commissions and other diplomatic posts across the world. </p></div>"},"offices":{"main":{"title":"British Trade & Cultural Office Taiwan","format":"World Office","updated_at":"2013-03-25T10:37:54+00:00","details":{"email":"info.taipei@fco.gov.uk","description":"Office hours: \r\nMonday to Friday\r\n9:00am to 12:30pm and 1:30pm to 5:00pm (Local Time)\r\n1:00am to 4:30am and 5:30am \u2013 9:00am (GMT)","contact_form_url":"","access_and_opening_times":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><h2 id=\"disabled-access\">Disabled access</h2>\n\n<p>The British Trade &amp; Cultural Office (BTCO) is keen to ensure that its offices and services are as accessible as possible to disabled members of the public.
