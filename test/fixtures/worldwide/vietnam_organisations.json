Before contacting an embassy or consulate with non-urgent enquiries, please read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide\">Support for British nationals abroad: a guide</a> to see if the information you need is there. If you still cannot find the information you need, you can contact your nearest Consular team.</p>\n\n<p>For legalisation and notarial services, you can only make an appointment after completing our normal procedure which is explained at the link <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-vietnam\">https://www.gov.uk/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-vietnam</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"disabled-access\">Disabled access</h2>\n\n<p>The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office and this embassy are keen to ensure that their buildings and services are fully accessible to disabled members of the public. Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible. Sometimes however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions. In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people. To assist disabled visitors, we have set out below details of disabled access at this embassy. We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-physical-access\">General physical access</h3>\n\n<p>There is clear, unobstructed access for vehicles to the front of the premises, but there are no curb ramps graded down from the sidewalks into the entrance pathway to the premises.
