International collaboration in science and innovation is also vital for meeting global policy challenges such as climate change, energy security and pandemic disease.</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office jointly fund the international Science and Innovation Network (SIN). SIN consists of 90 staff, based in 28 countries and 47 cities around the world. SIN officers engage with the local science and innovation community in support of UK policy overseas. They create strategic relationships to harness the value of science and innovation discoveries and investments overseas, leading to mutual UK and host-country benefits. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-sin-does\">What SIN does</h2>\n\n<p>SIN teams develop country specific action plans and work to the following global objectives: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>influence science and innovation policies of governments, industry and academia to benefit the UK</li>\n  <li>improve UK policy based on international experience and emerging opportunities and challenges</li>\n  <li>stimulate strategic science collaborations to benefit the UK and deliver wider policy goals </li>\n  <li>harness international technology partnerships and investment to grow UK innovation capability</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"recent-successes\">Recent successes</h2>\n\n<p>The outcomes and work of the Science and Innovation Network are publicised through the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/science-and-innovation-network-annual-report-2011-12\">SIN Annual Report</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"where-sin-is-based\">Where SIN is based</h2>\n\n<p>SIN is organised into four regions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"europe-including-russia\">Europe (including Russia)</h3>\n<p>Czech Republic (Prague), Denmark (Copenhagen), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin, Munich), Italy (Milan, Rome), Netherlands (The Hague), Poland (Warsaw), Russia (Moscow), Spain (Madrid), Sweden (Stockholm), Switzerland (Berne).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"asia-pacific\">Asia Pacific</h3>\n<p>Australia (Melbourne), China (Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai), Japan (Osaka, Tokyo), Malaysia (Kuala Lumpar), New Zealand (Wellington), Singapore, South Korea (Seoul), Taiwan (Taipei).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"middle-east-africa-and-south-asia\">Middle East, Africa and South Asia</h3>\n<p>India (Bangalore, Mumbai, New Delhi), Israel (Tel Aviv), Nigeria (Abuja), Qatar (Doha), South Africa (Pretoria, Cape Town).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"americas\">Americas</h3>\n<p>Brazil (Brasilia, Sao Paulo), Canada (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa), USA (Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-contact-sin\">How to contact SIN</h2>\n\n<p>To contact the Science and Innovation Network please <a href=\"mailto:sinmanagement@bis.gsi.gov.uk\">email SIN Management</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h2>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/international\">Research Councils UK (RCUK)</a> are responsible for investing public money in research in the UK.</p></div>","services":""},"offices":{"other":[]},"sponsors":[{"title":"Department for Business, Innovation & Skills","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills","details":{"acronym":"BIS"}},{"title":"Foreign & Commonwealth Office","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office","details":{"acronym":"FCO"}}]}],"current_page":1,"total":3,"pages":1,"page_size":20,"start_index":1,"_response_info":{"status":"ok","links":[{"href":"https://www.gov.uk/api/world-locations/japan/organisations?page=1","rel":"self"}]}}
