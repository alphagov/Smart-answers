Based initially in Benghazi, before returning to Tripoli in September 2011, the FCO is working to support Libya's transition to democracy and helping Libyans to build an accountable state based on the rule of law and respect for human rights.  Libya remains an important priority for the UK: the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have each visited twice since 2011 and Mr Burt, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, has visited three times.   ","description":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>By building strong relations with Libya\u2019s politicians, civil society groups, business leaders and security personnel across the country, the <abbr title=\"Foreign and Commonwealth Office\">FCO</abbr> is able to offer advice and political support to Libya\u2019s transition.  In 2012 we gave funding to the UN and other international organisations to provide assistance during Libya\u2019s first democratic elections for over 42 years.  Together with colleagues from the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defecne we support the newly elected congress and government as they seek to write a new constitution and introduce important reforms to Libya\u2019s security and economic sectors. </p>\n\n<p>We also work  to improve bilateral relations between the UK and Libya.  With our Bilateral Programme Budget we are able to fund small projects in cities outside Tripoli and develop friendships with Libyans in less-visited towns.  Through the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/chevening-scholarships-for-students-from-overseas\">Chevening Scholarships</a> we are able to support up to ten young Libyans with leadership potential to develop their skills and study in the UK.  </p>\n\n<p>Through our strong relationship with the Libyan government, we work to secure justice for the victims of Qadhafi\u2019s rule in the UK, including WPC Yvonne Fletcher and the victims of the Lockerbie disaster.  </p></div>","services":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><h2 id=\"visashttpswwwgovukuk-visa\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/uk-visa\">Visas</a></h2>\n\n<p>For information on whether you require a visa for the United Kingdom and how to apply go to the UK Border Agency website</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"births-deaths-and-marriageshttpswwwgovukbrowsebirths-deaths-marriages\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/browse/births-deaths-marriages\">Births, deaths and marriages</a></h2>\n\n<p>Information on how you can register a birth or death which occurred overseas, and legal documents for couples marrying or entering into civil partnerships abroad.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passports-and-emergency-travel-documentshttpswwwgovukoverseas-passports\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">Passports and emergency travel documents</a></h2>\n\n<p>How to renew or replace your British passport when visiting the UK and information on getting replacement travel documents if your passport is lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-advicehttpswwwgovukforeign-travel-advicelibya\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/libya\">Travel advice</a></h2>\n\n<p>Information on staying safe and avoiding problems when living or travelling abroad, with links to our embassies, high commissions and other diplomatic posts across the world.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"legalisation-servicehttpswwwgovukgovernmentpublicationslegalisation-general-guidance-leaflet\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legalisation-general-guidance-leaflet\">Legalisation Service</a></h2>\n\n<p>How to get official confirmation that your UK public documentation is genuine so it can be accepted by foreign authorities.
