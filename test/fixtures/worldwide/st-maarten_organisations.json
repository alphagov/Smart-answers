Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible. Sometimes however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions. In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people. To assist disabled visitors, we have set out below details of disabled access at this Consulate General. We hope this information is helpful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"general-physical-access\"\u003eGeneral physical access\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccess to the Consulate for wheelchairs is through the side entrance a few meters along the driveway into the rear carpark.
