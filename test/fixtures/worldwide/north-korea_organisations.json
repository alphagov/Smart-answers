","description":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>Our work concentrates on two main foreign policy areas: counter-proliferation and human rights. We support small-scale projects aimed at improving the lives of the most vulnerable in DPRK society. We also encourage people-to-people links through educational and cultural exchanges, and offer consular and visa services.</p>\n\n<p>Our flagship project is the British Council English Language Teacher Training Programme. This is a long-running project co-funded with the British Council, which aims to promote and improve English language teaching and training in the DPRK. It has been running for over ten years and currently has four Pyongyang-based trainers. They work in the DPRK\u2019s top universities, building their English language teaching capacity and exposing them to British materials and teaching methodology. The programme is providing positive results, and is expanding to cover new educational establishments and provide regional workshops.</p></div>","services":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><h2 id=\"visashttpwwwukbahomeofficegovukvisas-immigration-uk-border-agency-website\"><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/\" title=\"UK Border Agency website\">Visas</a></h2>\n<p>For information on whether you require a visa for the United Kingdom and how to apply go to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/\" title=\"UK Border Agency website\">UK Border Agency website</a> </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"births-deaths-and-marriageshttpswwwgovukbrowsebirths-deaths-marriages-births-deaths-and-marriages\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/browse/births-deaths-marriages/\" title=\"Births, deaths and marriages\">Births, deaths and marriages</a></h2>\n<p>Information on how you can register a birth or death which occurred overseas, and legal documents for couples marrying or entering into civil partnerships abroad. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passports-and-emergency-travel-documentshttpswwwgovukoverseas-passports-passports-and-emergency-travel-documents\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports/\" title=\"Passports and emergency travel documents\">Passports and emergency travel documents</a></h2>\n<p>How to renew or replace your British passport when visiting the UK and information on getting replacement travel documents if your passport is lost or stolen. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-advicehttpswwwgovukforeign-travel-advicenorth-korea-travel-advice\"><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/north-korea\" title=\"Travel advice\">Travel advice</a></h2>\n<p>Information on staying safe and avoiding problems when living or travelling abroad, with links to our embassies, high commissions and other diplomatic posts across the world. </p></div>"},"offices":{"main":{"title":" British Embassy Pyongyang","format":"World Office","updated_at":"2013-03-25T10:37:54+00:00","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-pyonyang/office/british-embassy-pyongyang","details":{"email":"","description":"Opening hours: \r\nMonday to Thursday - 9.00am to 6.00pm (local time); \r\nFriday - 9.00am to 1.00pm (local time)","contact_form_url":"","access_and_opening_times":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><h2 id=\"disabled-access\">Disabled access</h2>\n\n<p>The British Embassy in Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is keen to ensure that its buildings and services are fully accessible to disabled members of the public.</p>\n\n<p>Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible.
