Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible. Sometimes however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions. In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people. To assist disabled visitors, we have set out below details of disabled access at this Consulate General. We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-physical-access\">General physical access</h3>\n<p>Access to the Consulate for wheelchairs is through the side entrance a few meters along the driveway into the rear carpark. Although there are no ramps, the ground surface is safe and secure.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the entrance to the former Consular waiting room,  doors are wide enough for wheelchair access to the interview room. Please contact us on the number above if you are arriving by car and would like assistance on arrival. Our security guards and staff will be happy to help.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"access-for-visually-impaired-visitors\">Access for visually impaired visitors</h3>\n<p>Guide dogs are welcome.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"access-for-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-visitors\">Access for deaf and hard of hearing visitors</h3>\n<p>Hearing dogs are welcome.</p>\n</div>",
