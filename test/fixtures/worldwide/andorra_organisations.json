We prefer that you arrive at the embassy without them.   If this is not possible we  will  retain them at the entrance during your visit.  Visitors are required to pass through a number of security checks where such items will be detected.</p>\n\n<p>Weapons (including pepper sprays), or any object that our security staff consider could be used as a weapon (scissors, screwdrivers, small blades), are also forbidden. These will not be retained by our staff. Should you arrive with such an object you will not be granted access but will be asked to return without it.  </p>\n\n<p>These regulations are intended to help us ensure the security for our staff and visitors. Your cooperation is appreciated. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"parking\">Parking</h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately there is no public parking in Torre Espacio itself. The nearest public car park is La Paz car park, which is next to the Hospital La Paz and directly opposite Torre Espacio.</p>\n\n<p>La Paz car park can be accessed via Calle del Arzobispo Morcillo, next to the Hospital de la Paz on the north side of Torre Espacio. The car park offers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>24 hour service</li>\n  <li>Emergency battery for starting vehicles</li>\n  <li>Wheelchair hire service</li>\n  <li>Discount vouchers for business premises and available advertising spots.</li>\n</ul><p>More details on La Paz car park can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.metrovacesa.com/web/productos/aparcamientos/alquilar/promocion/aparcamiento-la-paz/13.422/\">MetroVacesa website</a></p>\n\n<p>If La Paz car park is full, there is a large public car park at Plaza Castilla (about 15 minutes walk from our offices). To get to the Consulate-General from Plaza Castilla, take the metro to Bego\u00f1a - see instructions below on how to arrive by metro.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bus\">Bus</h2>\n\n<p>For those who prefer to travel by bus to Torre Espacio you can find detailed information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.emtmadrid.es/index.html?lang=eng\">Madrid\u2019s municipal transport website</a> where you can plan your personalised route.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"metro\">Metro</h2>\n\n<p>The nearest metro stop is metro Bego\u00f1a (linea 10). When arriving at the station Bego\u00f1a take the exit sign posted La Paz or you will have a much longer walk to the Torre Espacio.
