<p>Your application will take <strong>at least</strong> 16 weeks from when it’s received by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Passport Office in the UK.</p>

<p>You may have to attend an interview.</p>

<p>Applications will take longer if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Passport Office needs to ask you for more information or documents</li>
  <li>the photographs you send are rejected</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t book travel until you have a valid passport. If you need to travel more urgently, you may be able to apply for an <a href="/emergency-travel-document">Emergency Travel Document.</a></p>

<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>

<p>You’ll have to pay a fee for your passport and a courier fee of £23.01. The courier fee pays for your passport to be sent securely to the British Embassy, high commission or consulate where you applied for you to collect.</p>

<p>Fill in a <a href="/government/publications/overseas-passport-creditdebit-card-payment-authorisation">‘Paying by credit card or debit card’ form</a> for each passport you’re applying for and submit it with your application. Your credit or debit card will be charged in sterling.</p>

<p>You can use Mastercard, Visa, Electron, Diners Club and JCB.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Download the application form.</li>
  <li>Use the ‘Applying for a passport if you’re outside the UK’ guidance notes to help you fill in the application form.</li>
  <li>Include 2 identical new photos of you (or your child, if it’s a child passport application). <a href="/photos-for-passports">Follow the rules about passport photos</a> or your application may be delayed.</li>
  <li>Check which supporting documents you must submit with your application. You must get documents that aren’t in English - including documents showing an address - fully translated by a professional translator.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="making-your-application">Making your application</h2>
<p>You must submit your passport application through the New Zealand Embassy in Dili.</p>

<p>You must apply in person. If you’re unable to, someone else can go on your behalf. You must bring photo ID with you.</p>

<p>Bring original supporting documents and a colour photocopy of each one. The original documents will be returned to you.</p>

<p>You must also bring your current passport with you when you apply, and a full colour photocopy of the entire passport (every page including blank pages).</p>

<p>You can’t travel with it after you’ve applied for a new one - but you will be able to keep your existing passport for ID purposes.</p>

<p>You need to book an appointment - contact the embassy to arrange one.</p>
