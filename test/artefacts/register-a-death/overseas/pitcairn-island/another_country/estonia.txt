$!You must register the death according to the regulations in Pitcairn Island. You will be given a local death certificate.$!

This local death certificate will be accepted in the UK (it may need to be a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document) of the document if it’s not in English).

##Register the death with the UK authorities

You can also apply to register the death with the British embassy in Estonia.

You don’t have to do this, but it means:

- a British-style death certificate will be issued
- having the death registered at the General Register Office in the UK

##How to register

Download and complete a [registration form](/government/publications/application-to-register-an-overseas-death).

##Documents

You must provide originals and a photocopy of:

- a local death certificate (not a certificate issued by a doctor)
- the person’s passport
- their full UK birth, naturalisation or registration certificate (if you can’t provide their passport)
- written permission from the person's next of kin or the ‘executor’ of their estate (if you’re not next of kin or the executor)

Fill in [form D1, 'Returning the passport of a deceased person'](/government/publications/returning-the-passport-of-a-deceased-person) if you provide their passport.

Fill in [form LS01, 'Lost or Stolen Passport Notification'](/government/publications/lost-or-stolen-passport-notification--2) if the passport is lost or unavailable.

##Cost

Service | Fee
-|-
Register a death | £105
Copy of a death registration certificate | £65

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/consular-fees).

You can order copies of the registration certificate from the British embassy when you register the death.

You can also get copies from the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk/) from September the year after you register - they will cost less.

##Go to the British embassy

You can book an appointment at the British embassy and bring along the registration form, supporting documents and the fee.



You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.

^Registration can take up to 3 months - your application will be sent to local British embassy, consulate or high commission where the death will be registered.^
