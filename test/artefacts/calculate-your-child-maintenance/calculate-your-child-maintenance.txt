Child maintenance calculator


You can use this calculator to estimate your child maintenance. It can help you to:

* agree an amount with the other parent if [you’re arranging it yourselves](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself)
* get an idea of the amount the government would work out for you (including collection and application fees)

The calculator is based on the rules used by the Child Maintenance Service. 

Don't use the calculator if you have a ['1993 scheme' or '2003 scheme' case](/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/child-maintenance-before-march-2003). These are managed by the [Child Support Agency](/child-maintenance/contact) (CSA).

^The calculator gives an estimate. The exact amount the Child Maintenance Service calculates may be different.^

##Before you start

You need information about the income of the parent who'll be paying.

Check the [child maintenance rates](/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/how-the-child-maintenance-service-works-out-child-maintenance) before you use the calculator.

##If your circumstances have changed

If you already have a case with the Child Support Agency (CSA) or the Child Maintenance Service and your circumstances have changed, [contact the office managing your case](/child-maintenance/contact). They’ll tell you if your child maintenance payments will change.
