<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (<abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.</p>

<p>If you need a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>, you must give notice of your intended marriage in Armenia. You must do this at a British embassy or in front of a notary public in that country.</p>

<p>You need to have been living in Armenia for 3 full days before you can post notice, eg if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.</p>

<p>You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your passport</li>
  <li>your <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">full birth certificate</a> or <a href="/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate">naturalisation certificate</a></li>
  <li>proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy or notary public to find out what you need</li>
  <li>equivalent documents for your partner</li>
</ul>

<p>If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="/copy-decree-absolute-final-order">decree absolute or final order</a></li>
  <li>a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate</li>
  <li>your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">death certificate</a></li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">translated</a> if it’s not in English.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll need to fill in forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry.</p>

<p>You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.</p>

<div class="form-download">

</div>

<h3 id="what-happens-next">What happens next</h3>

<p>The embassy or notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath.</p>

<p>If you give notice at a notary public, you must post the signed forms and any supporting documents to your nearest British embassy or consulate afterwards.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The embassy or consulate may charge a fee to return your documents to you.</p>
</div>

<p>The consulate will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.</p>

<p>They’ll then send all of your documentation to the British embassy or consulate nearest to where you’re getting married in Armenia, who will issue your <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> (as long as nobody has registered an objection).</p>

<p>There’s an additional fee for this - the embassy or consulate will contact you to arrange payment.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).</p>
</div>

<p>You should check if your <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Armenia.</p>

<p>Your partner can apply to <a href="/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen">become a British citizen</a> once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.</p>
