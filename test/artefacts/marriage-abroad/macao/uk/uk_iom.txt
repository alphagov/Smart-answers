You may be asked for a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or similar document. Check with the authorities in the [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry/) to find out what they can provide, then contact the authorities in Macao to confirm if this is acceptable.

The local British embassy or consulate may be able to advise if you have any problems getting the documents you need from the Manx authorities.
