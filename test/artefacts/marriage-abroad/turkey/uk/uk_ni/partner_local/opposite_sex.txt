<p>Contact the <a href="/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Embassy of Turkey</a> before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">get legal advice</a> and check the <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/turkey">travel advice for Turkey</a> before making any plans.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>Make an appointment with a UK <a rel="external" href="http://www.thenotariessociety.org.uk/find-a-notary">notary or commissioner of oaths</a> to swear an affidavit - a written statement that is used to formally declare that you’re free to marry.</p>

<p>You’ll need to complete an ‘Affidavit for marriage’ form that will be used for your affidavit. Take the completed form with you to your appointment.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/293781/Affidavit_of_Marital_Status.pdf">Download ’Affidavit for Marriage’ (PDF, 446KB)</a></p>
</div>

<p>You’ll need to get your affidavit ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">legalised</a>’ (certified as genuine) before you travel to Turkey.</p>

<p>If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="/copy-decree-absolute-final-order">decree absolute or final order</a> or <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">death certificate</a></li>
  <li>evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">translated</a> if it’s not in English</li>
  <li>evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.</p>
</div>

<p>Once the document is legalised you’ll need to have it checked at the local marriage office nearest to where your marriage will take place.</p>
