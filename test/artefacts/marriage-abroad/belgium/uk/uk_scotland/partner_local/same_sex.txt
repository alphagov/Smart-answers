Civil partnership in Belgium

Same-sex relationships in Belgium that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as:

- marriage
- ’cohabitation légale’, ’wettelijke samenwoning’, or ’gesetzliches zusammenwohnen’ (’statutory cohabitation’)


Contact the [Embassy of Belgium](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.


You should also check the [travel advice for Belgium](/foreign-travel-advice/belgium).


##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Belgium.

Contact the local British embassy or consulate where you’re planning the ceremony to find out what you need to do.
