- marriage
- ’cohabitation légale’, ’wettelijke samenwoning’, or ’gesetzliches zusammenwohnen’ (’statutory cohabitation’)


Contact the relevant local authorities in Belgium to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Belgium.
