##What documents you’ll need

You need to have been living in Germany for 21 days. You and your partner will need to sign a declaration and provide proof of residence eg, an employer’s letter or a bank statement.

You’ll both need to bring your original passports. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

##What you need to do
You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Germany.

Contact the local British embassy or consulate where you’re planning the ceremony to find out what you need to do.
