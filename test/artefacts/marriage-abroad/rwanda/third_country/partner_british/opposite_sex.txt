{::comment}begin-body{::/comment}
<p>Contact the relevant local authorities in Rwanda to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">get legal advice</a> and check the <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/rwanda">travel advice for Rwanda</a> before making any plans.</p>

<p>There aren’t any British consular facilities to register a marriage or get legal documents to prove you’re eligible to marry in Rwanda.</p>

<p>You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of <a href="/government/publications/rwanda-consular-fees">consular fees for Rwanda</a>.</p>

<p>You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.</p>

<p>The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.</p>
