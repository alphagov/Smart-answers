Marriage in Slovakia

Contact the register office ("Matrika") where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Slovakia](/foreign-travel-advice/slovakia) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

The Matrika will ask you to provide an [affirmation of marital status](/government/publications/affirmation-of-marital-status-in-slovakia-examples), signed by a local notary public in Slovakia, to prove you’re allowed to get married.

They’ll probably ask you for one or more documents issued in the UK, eg a birth certificate, death certificate or divorce documents.

### Legalisation and translation

UK-issued documents need to be:

- '[legalised](/get-document-legalised)' (certified as genuine)
- translated - [find a translator in Slovakia](/government/publications/slovakia-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) or ask for a list of translators at the Matrika
