<p>Contact the <a href="/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Embassy of Spain</a> before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<p>Civil weddings in Spain take place at a town hall, register office or district court. You need to register with the local civil authorities afterwards to get an official marriage certificate if you have a religious wedding.</p>

<p>Check with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&amp;tipo=RC">civil registry</a> where you’re getting married.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>There are certain legal restrictions if neither of you is resident in Spain. If you both live outside Spain, you should check with the civil registry where you’re planning to getting married to find out if this is allowed.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (<abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>), marital status certificate or both to prove you’re allowed to marry.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You may also need to get a marital status certificate if you’re living with your partner and want to get a ‘<a href="/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-spain#marital-status-certificate-for-pareja-de-hecho">pareja de hecho</a>’ (cohabitation registration).</p>
</div>

<p>You can normally get a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in <a href="/register-offices">England and Wales</a>, <a rel="external" href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/registration/reglist.pdf">Scotland</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire, but you should check with the local authorities in the country where you intend to marry to find out how long a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> is valid under local law.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="legalisation-and-translation">Legalisation and translation</h3>

<p>You might need to exchange your UK-issued <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> for one that’s valid in Spain at the nearest embassy or consulate to where you’re getting married.</p>

<p>You should also check if it needs to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘<a href="/get-document-legalised">legalised</a>’ (certified as genuine)</li>
  <li>translated - <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">find a translator abroad</a>, or in the UK through the <a rel="external" href="http://www.iol.org.uk/linguist/translator1.asp?r=PCTXYL10046">Institute of Linguists</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should also check with the local authorities in Spain to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).</p>
</div>

<h3 id="getting-a-marital-status-certificate">Getting a marital status certificate</h3>

<p>In some parts of Spain you may need to to get a ‘marital status certificate’ (‘certificado de estado civil’) instead of, or as well as, a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> (’certificado de no impedimento’).</p>

<p>Check with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&amp;tipo=RC">civil registry</a> where you’re getting married. If you need one, ask a <a href="/government/publications/spain-list-of-lawyers">solicitor</a> (‘abogado’) to draw up a declaration for you printed on their headed paper.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If it’s on blank, non-headed paper, they’ll need to give you a separate letter including their contact details, confirming that they’ve drawn up the declaration.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll then need to make an appointment at the consulate to make the declaration and sign the document in front of a consular officer - so don’t sign it beforehand.</p>

<p>Download instructions in English and Spanish on what the declaration needs to include.</p>

<h3 id="other-requirements-for-spain">Other requirements for Spain</h3>

<p>The civil registrar may also ask for confirmation of your addresses for the past 2 years (‘confirmación de domicilio para casarse en España’).</p>

<p>You’ll need to show one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a letter confirming your address, eg electoral roll</li>
  <li>a bank or building society statement, credit card statement</li>
  <li>a mortgage statement</li>
  <li>a council tax letter</li>
  <li>utility bills</li>
  <li>recent proof of entitlement to local or state benefits, eg tax credits, pension, education or other benefits</li>
</ul>
