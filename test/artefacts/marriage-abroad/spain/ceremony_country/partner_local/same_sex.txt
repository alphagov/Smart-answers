Marriage in Spain

Contact the relevant local authorities in Spain to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


The process for same-sex marriages in Spain is the same as for opposite-sex civil marriages. Your marriage will be recognised as a civil partnership under British law.


Check with the [civil registry](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC) where you’re getting married.


##What you need to do


You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI), marital status certificate or both to prove you’re allowed to marry.

^You may also need to get a marital status certificate if you’re living with your partner and want to get a ‘[pareja de hecho](/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-spain#marital-status-certificate-for-pareja-de-hecho)’ (cohabitation registration).^


If you need a CNI, you must give notice of your intended marriage in Spain. You must do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public in that country.


The documents you need are:

- your passport
- your partner’s passport or national identity document
- a ‘certificado de empadronamiento’ (town hall registration certificate) or Spanish police residence certificate (green document with your NIE number address) issued at least 3 days ago

^The Civil Registry will usually ask you for a certificado de empadronamiento issued in the last 3 months.^


If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)


Send your completed CNI service request form and copies of the supporting documents to your [nearest British consulate](/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-spain#where-to-send-your-request). You can send them as scanned attachments by email or by fax. You’ll need to bring the original documents to your appointment.

To request an appointment, fill in the CNI service request form and make sure you’ve got all of the necessary supporting documents.

###What happens next

The consulate will check your form and documents, and if everything’s in order they’ll send you details of how to book your appointment to give official notice of your marriage. They’ll then display your notice publicly for 7 days, and if nobody has raised an objection, they’ll issue your CNI. There’s an additional fee for this.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%


###Getting a marital status certificate

In some parts of Spain you may need to to get a ‘marital status certificate’ (‘certificado de estado civil’) instead of, or as well as, a CNI (’certificado de no impedimento’).

Check with the [civil registry](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC) where you’re getting married. If you need one, ask a [solicitor](/government/publications/spain-list-of-lawyers) (‘abogado’) to draw up a declaration for you printed on their headed paper.

^If it’s on blank, non-headed paper, they’ll need to give you a separate letter including their contact details, confirming that they’ve drawn up the declaration.^

You’ll then need to make an appointment at the consulate to make the declaration and sign the document in front of a consular officer - so don’t sign it beforehand.

Download instructions in English and Spanish on what the declaration needs to include.

###Other requirements for Spain

The civil registrar may also ask for confirmation of your addresses for the past 2 years (‘confirmación de domicilio para casarse en España’).

You’ll need to show one of the following:

- a letter confirming your address, eg electoral roll
- a bank or building society statement, credit card statement
- a mortgage statement
- a council tax letter
- utility bills
- recent proof of entitlement to local or state benefits, eg tax credits, pension, education or other benefits


##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.


^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^
