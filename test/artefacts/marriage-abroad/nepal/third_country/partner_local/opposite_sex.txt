Marriage in Nepal

Contact the relevant local authorities in Nepal to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Nepal](/foreign-travel-advice/nepal) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/nepal/uk/partner_local/opposite_sex)
- [go to Nepal and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/nepal/ceremony_country/partner_local/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice in Nepal, you’ll normally have to wait at least 10 days before you can get married.%
