<p>The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (<abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.</p>

<p>You must provide evidence that you’re allowed to marry if you’re resident in Cyprus but you’ve been there for less than 3 years. However, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/">General Register Office</a> (<abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>) in the UK can only provide letters covering a specified 3-year period, not including the most recent 18 months.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="http://www.ucm.org.cy/Account_List.aspx">contact the municipality</a> in the area of Cyprus where you’d like to marry to check if they’ll accept this.</p>
