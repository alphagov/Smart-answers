Marriage in China

Contact the relevant local authorities in China to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^


##What you need to do


Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in China nearest to the address in your partner’s Hukou (family registration) book, to swear an affirmation/affadavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport, your partner’s Hukou and pay a fee.

You’ll need to complete an [‘Affirmation for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmation-form-china) (non-religious) form or an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affidavit-form-china) (religious) form in English.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English


You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.


^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
