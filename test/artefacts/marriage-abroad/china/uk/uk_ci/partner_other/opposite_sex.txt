Marriage in China

Contact the [Embassy of China](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for China](/foreign-travel-advice/china) before making any plans.


##What you need to do


Make an appointment at your local British embassy or consulate in China to swear an affirmation/affadavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

You’ll need to complete an [‘Affirmation for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmation-form-china) (non-religious) form or an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affidavit-form-china) (religious) form in English.
