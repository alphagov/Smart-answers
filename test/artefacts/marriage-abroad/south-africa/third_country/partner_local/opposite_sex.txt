<p>The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (<abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You’ll probably be asked for a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> if you want to marry a South African citizen in South Africa. You’ll need to ask if there are any other documents the authorities will accept instead.</p>
