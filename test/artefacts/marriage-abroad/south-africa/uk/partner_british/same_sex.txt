Marriage in South Africa


Contact the [relevant local authorities](http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/civic-services/marriage-certificates) in South Africa to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for South Africa](/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa) before making any plans.^

The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNIs) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You can get a letter to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Book an appointment to collect a letter at the [British Consulate General in Cape Town](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-consulate-general-cape-town/providing-an-informative-note/slot_picker) or the [British High Commission in Pretoria](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-high-commission-pretoria/providing-an-informative-note/slot_picker).

The letter is free. If you can't go to an appointment, you can ask a friend or family member to make an appointment and collect it for you.
