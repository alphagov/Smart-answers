<p>Contact the relevant local authorities to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">get legal advice</a> before making any plans.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll need to swear an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) in front of a notary public stating that you’re free to marry.</p>

<p>You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2">Download ‘Notice of marriage’</a></p>

<p><a href="/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form">Download ‘Affidavit for marriage’</a></p>
</div>

<p>The notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then give you your notice of marriage. You should take this notice to the local authorities where you’re getting married.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).</p>
