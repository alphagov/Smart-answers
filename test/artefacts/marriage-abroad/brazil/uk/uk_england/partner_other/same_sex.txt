Civil partnership in Brazil{::comment}end-title{::/comment}

{::comment}begin-body{::/comment}
<p>Same-sex relationships in Brazil that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>marriage</li>
  <li>’união estável’, or ’stable union’.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should check the <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/brazil">travel advice for Brazil</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Brazil.</p>

<p>You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in <a href="/register-offices">England and Wales</a>, <a rel="external" href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/registration/reglist.pdf">Scotland</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire, but you should check with the local authorities in the country where you intend to marry to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="legalisation-and-translation">Legalisation and translation</h3>

<p>You might need to exchange your UK-issued CNI for one that’s valid in Brazil at the nearest embassy or consulate to where you’re getting married.</p>

<p>You should also check if it needs to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘<a href="/get-document-legalised">legalised</a>’ (certified as genuine)</li>
  <li>translated - <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">find a translator abroad</a>, or in the UK through the <a rel="external" href="http://www.iol.org.uk/linguist/translator1.asp?r=PCTXYL10046">Institute of Linguists</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should also check with the local authorities in Brazil to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).</p>
</div>

<h2 id="naturalisation-of-your-partner-if-they-move-to-the-uk">Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK</h2>

<p>Your partner can apply to <a href="/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen">become a British citizen</a> once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.</p>

<p>You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of <a href="/government/publications/brazil-consular-fees">consular fees for Brazil</a>.</p>

<p>You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.</p>
