<p>Contact the <a href="/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">High Commission of Malaysia</a> to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<p>The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (<abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.</p>

<p>The British High Commission in Malaysia can provide you with a letter explaining this position for a charge - see <a href="/government/publications/malaysia-consular-fees">consular fees for Malaysia</a>.</p>
