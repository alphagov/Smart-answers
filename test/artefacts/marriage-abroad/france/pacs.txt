<p>Contact the ’tribunal d’instance’ in the town where you’re entering into a <abbr title="pacte civil de solidarité">PACS</abbr> to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<p>If you’re not in France, <a rel="external" href="http://www.mfe.org/index.php/Annuaires/Ambassades-et-consulats-francais-a-l-etranger">your closest French embassy</a> may also be able to give you advice, or put you in touch with the relevant local authorities if you don’t know who to contact.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should <a href="/government/publications/france-list-of-lawyers">get legal advice</a> before making any plans.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>You may be asked to provide a certificate of custom law (‘certificat de coutume’) if you’re entering into a <abbr title="pacte civil de solidarité">PACS</abbr> in France.</p>

<p>You should check with the tribunal d’instance to find out if you need one.</p>

<p>If you need a certificate of custom law, you can get one from the <a href="/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris">British Embassy in Paris</a>.</p>

<p>Some tribunals only accept a certificate of custom dated less than 6 months before the date of your <abbr title="pacte civil de solidarité">PACS</abbr>. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-a-certificate-of-custom-law-from-the-british-embassy">Applying for a certificate of custom law from the British Embassy</h3>

</li>
<li><p>Make sure you’ve got all of the supporting documents you need - there’s a checklist on the form.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You’ll need to include a pre-paid self-addressed envelope and a registered letter slip (‘récépissé d’un envoi recommandé sans avis de réception’) with your name and address, or a €6.55 postage fee, if you want your documents to be returned.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Send your completed form to the British Embassy with your supporting documents and the correct fee. You’ll have to pay in Euros, as instructed on the payment slip attached to the form.

</ol>

<h3 id="the-certificate-of-celibacy">The certificate of celibacy</h3>

<p>The tribunal might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not already married or in a civil partnership. It’s not possible to provide this under UK law, so you’ll need to download the explanatory note and take this to the tribunal instead.</p>

<p>If your partner isn’t British, they can apply to <a href="/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen">become a British citizen</a> once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.</p>
