Contact the relevant local authorities in Italy to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents youâ€™ll need.


You may be asked for a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or similar document. Check with the authorities in [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us) to find out what they can provide, then contact the authorities in Italy to confirm if this is acceptable.

The local British embassy or consulate may be able to advise if you have any problems getting the documents you need from the authorities in Jersey or Guernsey.
