<p>Contact the local comune (town hall) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>You’ll need to get a certificate of no impediment (<abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>) from the authorities in the UK to prove you’re allowed to marry.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your partner will need to follow the same process to get their own <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<p>You can normally get a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in <a href="/register-offices">England and Wales</a>, <a rel="external" href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/registration/reglist.pdf">Scotland</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire, but you should check with the local authorities in the country where you intend to marry to find out how long a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> is valid under local law.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="getting-a-statutory-declaration">Getting a statutory declaration</h3>

<p>While you’re waiting for your <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>, you and your partner will need to make a statutory declaration before a <a rel="external" href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/">solicitor or public notary</a>. The Italian authorities will need this in addition to your <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>. There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/153753/bilingual-statutory-declaration.pdf">Download ‘Bilingual statutory declaration for marriage in Italy’ (PDF, 90KB)</a></p>
</div>

<h3 id="legalisation-and-translation">Legalisation and translation</h3>

<p>You’ll need to get your statutory declaration and <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> ’<a href="/get-document-legalised">legalised</a>’ (certified as genuine) by the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (<abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>).</p>

<p>You’ll also need to get your <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> <a href="/government/publications/italy-list-of-lawyers">translated</a> and sworn before the Italian courts or an Italian Justice of the Peace.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).</p>
</div>

<p>You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.</p>
