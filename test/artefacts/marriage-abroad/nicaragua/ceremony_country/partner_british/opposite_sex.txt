{::comment}begin-body{::/comment}
<p>Contact the relevant local authorities in Nicaragua to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">get legal advice</a> before making any plans.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (<abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.</p>

<p>If you need a <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>, you must arrange this through the British Embassy in Costa Rica because there aren’t any British consular facilities in Nicaragua.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

<br />Paseo Colón and Streets 38 and 40
<br />San Jose<br />Costa Rica<br />

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-in-costa-rica/office/british-embassy">British Embassy - opening hours</a></p>
</div>

<p>You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your passport</li>
  <li>your <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">full birth certificate</a> or <a href="/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate">naturalisation certificate</a></li>
  <li>proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need</li>
  <li>equivalent documents for your partner</li>
</ul>

<p>If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="/copy-decree-absolute-final-order">decree absolute or final order</a></li>
  <li>a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate</li>
  <li>your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">death certificate</a></li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">translated</a> if it’s not in English.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll need to fill in forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry.</p>

<p>You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2">Download ‘Notice of marriage’</a></p>

<p><a href="/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form">Download ‘Affidavit for marriage’</a></p>
</div>

<h3 id="what-happens-next">What happens next</h3>

<p>The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).</p>
</div>

<p>You should check if your <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Nicaragua.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.</p>

<p>You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of <a href="/government/publications/nicaragua-consular-fees">consular fees for Nicaragua</a>.</p>

<p>You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.</p>
