<p>Contact the <a href="/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Embassy of Ecuador</a> before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.</p>

<p>Make an appointment at the local British embassy or consulate in Ecuador to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.</p>

<h3 id="legalisation-and-translation">Legalisation and translation</h3>

<p>You might need to get your affirmation <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">translated</a> into the local language and ‘<a href="/get-document-legalised">legalised</a>’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.</p>

<p>If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="/copy-decree-absolute-final-order">decree absolute or final order</a> or <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">death certificate</a></li>
  <li>evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">translated</a> if it’s not in English</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.</p>
</div>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).</p>

<h2 id="naturalisation-of-your-partner-if-they-move-to-the-uk">Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK</h2>

<p>Your partner can apply to <a href="/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen">become a British citizen</a> once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.</p>

<p>You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of <a href="/government/publications/ecuador-consular-fees">consular fees for Ecuador</a>.</p>

<p>You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.</p>
