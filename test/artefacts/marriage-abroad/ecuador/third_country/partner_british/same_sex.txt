<p>Same-sex relationships in Ecuador that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as ‘unión civil’, or ‘civil union’.</p>

<p>Contact the relevant local authorities in Ecuador to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<p>You should also check the <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/ecuador">travel advice for Ecuador</a>.</p>
