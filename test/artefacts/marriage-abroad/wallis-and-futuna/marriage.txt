Marriage in Wallis And Futuna{::comment}end-title{::/comment}

{::comment}begin-body{::/comment}
<p>Wallis And Futuna is an overseas department or territory of France. The rules and requirements for getting married there are similar to France.</p>

<p>Contact the local town hall (‘mairie’) where you’re getting married to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<p>If you’re not in France, <a rel="external" href="http://www.mfe.org/index.php/Annuaires/Ambassades-et-consulats-francais-a-l-etranger">your closest French embassy</a> may also be able to give you advice, or put you in touch with the relevant local authorities if you don’t know who to contact.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should <a href="/government/publications/france-list-of-lawyers">get legal advice</a> before making any plans.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>You may be asked to provide a certificate of custom law (‘certificat de coutume’) if you’re getting married in Wallis And Futuna.</p>

<p>You should check with the mairie in the town where you’re getting married to find out if you need one. Either you or your partner will need to have been legally resident there for at least 40 days before the ceremony.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll need to have a civil ceremony first if you’re getting married in a religious ceremony.</p>
</div>

<p>If you need a certificate of custom law, you can get one from the <a href="/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris">British Embassy in Paris</a>.</p>

<p>Some mairies only accept a certificate of custom dated less than 6 months before the date of marriage. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.</p>

<h3 id="the-certificate-of-celibacy">The certificate of celibacy</h3>

<p>The mairie might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not married or in a civil partnership. There’s no equivalent to this document in British law, so you’ll need to download the official note which explains this and take it to the mairie instead.</p>
