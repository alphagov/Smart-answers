You may be asked for a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or similar document. Check with the authorities in [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us) to find out what they can provide, then contact the authorities in Costa Rica to confirm if this is acceptable.
