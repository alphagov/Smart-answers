Marriage in Cambodia


Contact the [Embassy of Cambodia](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.



%There are certain restrictions on getting married in Cambodia if neither of you is Cambodian. If neither of you is Cambodian, you must check with both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the local Sangkat to find out if if you can get married.%

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Cambodia to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry.

You’ll need to bring your passport, your partner’s passport (or Cambodian ID card) and pay a fee.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.




^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation as well.^



## What happens next

You’ll need to take the following to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

- your affirmation
- a certified copy of your passport
- your birth certificate or naturalisation certificate
- proof of residence, eg a residence certificate - check with the embassy or consulate for advice

You’ll be asked to provide a criminal record check – check with the embassy how to do this.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue an approval letter which you’ll need to take to the Ministry of Interior. The Ministry of Interior may ask you to complete additional forms and will give you an approval letter.

You’ll need to take the approval letters to your local Sangkat for the marriage registration.
