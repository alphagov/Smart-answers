<p>There aren’t any British consular facilities to register a marriage or get legal documents to prove you’re eligible to marry in the USA.</p>

<p>You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of <a href="/government/publications/usa-consular-fees">consular fees for the USA</a>.</p>

<p>You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.</p>
