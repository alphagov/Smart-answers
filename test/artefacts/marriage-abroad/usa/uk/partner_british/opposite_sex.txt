Marriage in the USA

Contact your [nearest embassy or consulate](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) representing the USA before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for the USA](/foreign-travel-advice/usa) before making any plans.


There aren’t any British consular facilities to register a marriage or get legal documents to prove you’re eligible to marry in the USA.


You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for the USA](/government/publications/usa-consular-fees).


You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.
