{::comment}begin-body{::/comment}
<p>You may be able to register a civil partnership at the British embassy or consulate in Guatemala.</p>

<p>Contact them to make an appointment:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>
British Embassy<br />Edificio Torre Internacional, 
<br />Nivel 11, 16 Calle 0-55, 
<br />Zona 10 Guatemala City <br />Guatemala<br />
</p></div></div>

<div class="contact">
<p>Switchboard: +502-2380-7300</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-documents-youll-need">What documents you’ll need</h2>

<p>You’ll need proof that you’ve been resident in the area covered by the British embassy or consulate for at least 7 days, like an employer’s letter or a bank statement.</p>

<p>You’ll both need your original passports. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="/copy-decree-absolute-final-order">decree absolute or final order</a>, or</li>
  <li>the <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">death certificate</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Your partner will also need either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a ‘certificate of no impediment’ (<abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr>) or similar document to prove they’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership from their national authorities</li>
  <li>an official letter from the local authorities in the country where they’re resident confirming that they’re single</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Any foreign documents may need to be ’<a href="/get-document-legalised">legalised</a>’ (certified as genuine) in the country they were issued (or that country’s embassy in Guatemala), and <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">translated into English</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h3>

<p>Once you’ve made your appointment, the British embassy or consulate will give you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a notice of registration</li>
  <li>a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to enter into a civil partnership</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee (see below), the British embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.</p>

<p>As long as nobody has registered an objection after this time, the registration officer can then register your partnership any time until 3 months after the date you gave notice.</p>

<p>You’ll need to provide two witnesses and pay a fee to register your civil partnership. You’ll need to pay an additional fee for your civil partnership certificate (see below).</p>

<h2 id="naturalisation-of-your-partner-if-they-move-to-the-uk">Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK</h2>

<p>Your partner can apply to <a href="/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen">become a British citizen</a> once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.</p>
