Marriage in Mali

Contact the relevant local authorities in Mali to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

There aren’t any British consular facilities to register a marriage or get legal documents to prove you’re eligible to marry in Mali.

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for Mali](/government/publications/mali-consular-fees).

You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.
