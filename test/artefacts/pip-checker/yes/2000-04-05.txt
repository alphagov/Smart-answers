When you’ll be invited to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP) depends on when your [Disability Living Allowance (DLA)](/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit) ends. You’ll also be invited to claim PIP if your needs change before your DLA ends.

## Your DLA ends before September 2017

You’ll be told 20 weeks before your DLA ends and invited to claim PIP.

Contact the [Disability Benefits helpline](/disability-benefits-helpline) if your DLA payment is due to end in the next 4 weeks and you haven’t received a letter about making a new claim.

^Your payment may stop if you don’t contact the helpline.^

##Your DLA ends after September 2017 or your DLA award has no end date

You can be contacted any time to claim PIP. This includes if you have a long-term award of DLA or an indefinite award with no end date.

Not everyone will be contacted to claim PIP right away. You’ll continue to get DLA until Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) writes to you about when it will end.

##If your needs change

You must let DWP know if your [care or mobility needs change](/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit/eligibility). You’ll be invited to claim PIP.
