If you're still getting Disability Living Allowance, when you'll be invited to claim PIP depends on:

- when your DLA ends
- your postcode area

###Your DLA ends before September 2017

You'll be told 20 weeks before your DLA ends and invited to claim PIP in most areas of England, Scotland and Wales.

^Contact the [Disability Benefits helpline](/disability-benefits-helpline) if your DLA payment is due to end in less than 28 days and you haven’t received a letter about making a new claim. Your payment may stop if you don’t.^

You'll also be invited to claim PIP if you tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that your care or mobility needs have changed.


In the following areas you'll be asked to claim PIP from 27 July 2015:

- AL (St Albans)

- EN (Enfield)
- HA (Harrow)
- HS (Hebrides)
- KT (Kingston)
- KW (Kirkwall)
- ME (Maidstone)
- N (London North)

- SL (Slough)
- SM (Sutton)
- TN (Tonbridge)
- TW (Twickenham)
- UB (Uxbridge)
- W (London West)
- WD (Watford)
- ZE (Lerwick)

###Your DLA ends after September 2017 or DLA awards with no end date

Some people will be invited to claim PIP from 13 July 2015 if you live in the following areas:

- Blackburn (BB)
- Bolton (BL)
- Derby (DE)
- Leicester (LE)
- Manchester (M)
- Oldham (OL)
- Preston (PR)
- Stoke (ST)
- Warrington (WA)

This includes if you have an indefinite or long-term awards of DLA.

^You can be contacted anytime between 13 July 2015 and 30 September 2017. Not everyone in these postcode areas will be contacted to claim PIP right away.^

You'll continue to get DLA until DWP writes to you about when it will end.
