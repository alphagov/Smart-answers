##Documents

You and the other parent must provide:

- your child’s local birth certificate
- your British birth certificates (long version) showing details of your parents
- a naturalisation or registration certificate (if either of you were not born in the UK)
- your current British passports
- a copy of a passport or birth certificate (if one of you isn’t British)
- a marriage certificate (if you’re married)
- divorce documents (if either of you has ever been divorced)

You’ll need to provide originals and a photocopy of each document.

##Cost

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/consular-fees).

You can order copies of the registration certificate from the British embassy when you register the birth.

Cheaper copies will be available from the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk) in the UK, but not until September the year after you register.

##Go to the British embassy

Book an appointment at the British embassy and bring the registration form, supporting documents and the fee.

Either parent can register the birth.



You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.
