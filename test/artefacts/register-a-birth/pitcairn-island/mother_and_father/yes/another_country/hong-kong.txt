You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/consular-fees).

You can order copies of the registration certificate from the British consulate general when you register the birth.

Cheaper copies will be available from the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk) in the UK, but not until September the year after you register.
