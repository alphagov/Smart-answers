You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/consular-fees).

You can order copies of the registration certificate from the British high commission when you register the birth.

Cheaper copies will be available from the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk) in the UK, but not until September the year after you register.

##Go to the British high commission

Book an appointment at the British high commission and bring the registration form, supporting documents and the fee.

The mother must register the birth. If you want the father’s name on the consular birth certificate, both parents will need to swear a paternity declaration in person at the nearest consulate.

Paternity declarations are free. Contact the consulate for more details.


##Send your registration

You can also post your registration form, supporting documents and the fee to the British high commission.

Pay by bank cheque made payable to the ‘British High Commission’. Credit cards, personal or company cheques aren’t accepted.
