$!You can apply to register the birth with the British embassy in Libya.$!

Download and complete the [birth registration form](/government/publications/application-to-register-an-overseas-birth).

##Documents

You and the other parent must provide:

- your child’s local birth certificate
- your British birth certificates (long version) showing details of your parents
- a naturalisation or registration certificate (if either of you were not born in the UK)
- your current British passports
- a copy of a passport or birth certificate (if one of you isn’t British)
- a marriage certificate (if you’re married)
- divorce documents (if either of you has ever been divorced)

You’ll need to provide originals and a photocopy of each document.

##Cost

Service | Fee
-|-
Register a birth | £105
Copy of a birth registration certificate | £65

You can only pay fees for consular services in cash in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/consular-fees).

You can order copies of the registration certificate from the British embassy when you register the birth.

Cheaper copies will be available from the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk) in the UK, but not until September the year after you register.

##Go to the British embassy

Book an appointment at the British embassy and bring the registration form, supporting documents and the fee.

The mother must register the birth. If you want the father’s name on the consular birth certificate, both parents will need to swear a paternity declaration in person at the nearest consulate.

Paternity declarations are free. Contact the consulate for more details.



%You can only pay by cash, which must be in local currency.%
