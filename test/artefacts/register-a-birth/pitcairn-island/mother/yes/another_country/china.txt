Download and complete the [birth registration form](/government/publications/application-to-register-an-overseas-birth).

##Documents

You and the other parent must provide:

- your child’s local birth certificate
- your British birth certificates (long version) showing details of your parents
- a naturalisation or registration certificate (if either of you were not born in the UK)
- your current British passports
- a copy of a passport or birth certificate (if one of you isn’t British)
- a marriage certificate (if you’re married)
- divorce documents (if either of you has ever been divorced)

You’ll need to provide originals and a photocopy of each document.

##Cost

Service | Fee
-|-
Register a birth | £105
Copy of a birth registration certificate | £65

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/consular-fees).

You can order copies of the registration certificate from the British consulate when you register the birth.

Cheaper copies will be available from the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk) in the UK, but not until September the year after you register.

##Go to the British consulate

Book an appointment at the British consulate and bring the registration form, supporting documents and the fee.

Either parent can register the birth.
