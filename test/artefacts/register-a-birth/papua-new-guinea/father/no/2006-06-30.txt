$!You must register the birth according to the regulations in Papua New Guinea.$!

You can’t register your child’s birth with the UK authorities abroad. This is because unmarried fathers can’t pass on British nationality to a child born before 1 July 2006.

You may still be able to apply for [British citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/citizenship) for the child.

You may also be able to register the birth if you’ve married the other parent since the child was born. [Contact your local British embassy](/government/world) to find out.
