Based on your answers, you’re not affected by the outside London benefit cap.

This is because the total amount of benefits you get are the same as or lower than this benefit cap.

##How this is worked out

The total amount of your benefits are added together:

Total amount of benefits affected by cap: £350

As this amount is lower than the outside London benefit cap of  £384.62, your benefits won’t change.

This is an estimate only. Contact the Department for Work and Pensions if you need further help.
