Youâ€™ll need a visa to come to the UK

Apply for a [Marriage Visitor visa](/marriage-visa) if you and your partner want to get married or enter into a civil partnership in the UK.

If you want to live in the UK permanently, you must apply for a [family of a settled person visa](/join-family-in-uk) if your partner is any of the following:

- a British citizen
- settled in the UK
- someone with humanitarian protection, for example if they have refugee status

^If you want to convert a civil partnership into a marriage, you'll need to apply for an [electronic visa waiver (EVW)](/get-electronic-visa-waiver) or a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor-visa).
