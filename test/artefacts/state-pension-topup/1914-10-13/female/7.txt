To top up your pension by £7 per week, you’ll need to make a lump sum payment of either:

- £889 when you're 100

Make sure you’ll get the full [basic State Pension](/state-pension-statement) before making Class 3A contributions.

You should get [financial advice](/plan-retirement-income/get-financial-advice) when planning your retirement income.

The contribution amount is an estimate.

To register your interest in the scheme and to get updates, email <statepension.topup@dwp.gsi.gov.uk>.
