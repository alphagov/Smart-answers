<p>You may not qualify for the new State Pension. Under the new State Pension rules <a href="/new-state-pension/eligibility">you need at least 10 years</a> of National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>Check if the time <a href="/new-state-pension/living-and-working-overseas">you lived or worked overseas</a> can help you meet the 10 years you need.</p>

<p>The State Pension age is regularly reviewed and may change in the future.</p>

<p>This estimate doesn’t include any <a href="/additional-state-pension">Additional State Pension</a> you may have before 6 April 2016. It may change if you make more <a href="/national-insurance">National Insurance contributions</a> before you reach State Pension age.</p>

<p>How much State Pension you get depends on how many years of <a href="/national-insurance">National Insurance contributions</a> you have.</p>
