<p>You’re close to State Pension age. You’ll reach it on  1 February 2015.</p>

<p>Your State Pension age is 65 years.</p>

<p>You can now <a href="/state-pension/how-to-claim">claim your State Pension</a> if you haven’t already done so.</p>

<p>Once you claim your <a href="/state-pension">State Pension</a>, the Pension Service will work out exactly how much you get.</p>

<h2 id="your-state-pension-estimate">Your State Pension estimate</h2>

<p>You currently don’t have the 30 qualifying years needed to get a full basic State Pension of £113.1 per week.</p>
