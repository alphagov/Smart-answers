This person can’t rent your property because they haven't shown you documents to prove their right to rent.

You might get a [fine (civil penalty)](/penalties-illegal-renting) if you rent your property to them.

If the person is already renting your property, you must [report them to the Home Office.](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/lcs-reporting.ofml)
