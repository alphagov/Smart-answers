Check if someone can rent your residential property

Find out if someone can rent private residential property in England.

You must check anyone aged 18 or over who pays to use your property as their main home, eg tenants, sub-tenants and paying house guests.

If you’ve bought a property that is already occupied by tenants you should see if a check has been carried out. You’ll be responsible for carrying out [further checks on your tenants](/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents).

^You can read more about the [right to rent documents](/government/publications/right-to-rent-document-checks-a-user-guide) you can accept as proof.^
