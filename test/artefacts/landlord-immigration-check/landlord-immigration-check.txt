Check if someone can rent your residential property

Find out if someone can rent private residential property in the UK.

This includes private residential properties for all people aged 18 or over (including house guests, lodgers and sub-tenants) who will use the property as their main home.

You only have to do this check for new tenancies which started on or after 1 December 2014.

If you’ve bought a property that is already occupied by tenants you should see if a check has been carried out. You’ll be responsible for carrying out [further checks on your tenants](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice).

^You can read more about the [right to rent documents](/government/publications/rules-and-acceptable-documents-right-to-rent-checks) if you can’t tell what kind of document your tenant is using to rent your property.^
