<h2 id="certifying-documents">Certifying documents</h2>

<p>If you provide a certified document, it must be certified in the UK by a solicitor or ‘notary public’.</p>

<p>When the solicitor or notary public signs the document, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>note the type of certification they have done (eg the document is a true copy of the original)</li>
  <li>use their personal signature, not a company signature</li>
  <li>include the date of certification</li>
  <li>include their company address</li>
</ul>

<p>If they add a notarial certificate, it must be attached to the document. The certificate must also  contain a specific reference to the document they have certified.</p>

<p>If a notary public from England, Wales or Northern Ireland signs a document for legalisation, they must also stamp or emboss the document with their notarial seal.</p>
