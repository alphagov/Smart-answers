<h2 id="marriage-certificate">Marriage certificate</h2>

<p>Your marriage certificate can be legalised if it’s either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an official certified copy of the certificate issued by the General Register Office (GRO) with the original seal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an original certificate (or original certified copy) issued by a church, religious establishment or local register office, with the original signature of the official who issued the certificate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It can take longer to legalise a signature on an original certificate, especially if it was issued before 1991.</p>

<p>It might be quicker to order a certified copy of your certificate from the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/default.asp">GRO (England and Wales)</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/contacts/opentime/index.html/">GRO for Scotland</a></li>

<h2 id="certifying-documents">Certifying documents</h2>

<p>If you provide a certified document, it must be certified in the UK by a solicitor or ‘notary public’.</p>

<p>When the solicitor or notary public signs the document, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>note the type of certification they have done (eg the document is a true copy of the original)</li>
  <li>use their personal signature, not a company signature</li>
  <li>include the date of certification</li>
  <li>include their company address</li>
</ul>

<p>If they add a notarial certificate, it must be attached to the document. The certificate must also  contain a specific reference to the document they have certified.</p>

<p>If a notary public from England, Wales or Northern Ireland signs a document for legalisation, they must also stamp or emboss the document with their notarial seal.</p>
