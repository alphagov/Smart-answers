Your State Pension will normally be based on your own National Insurance contributions only.

Your State Pension may be worked out in a different way if 1 of the following applied before 1977:

- you paid National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate
- you chose not to pay Class 2 contributions if you were self-employed

This is also known as the [married women’s reduced rate election](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/reducedrate/marriedwomen.htm) (also known as the Married Woman’s Stamp).

^Your State Pension may be higher if the reduced rate election applies to you.^

The Reduced Rate Election must have applied to you at some point within the 35 years before you reached State Pension age (not including the year you reach State Pension age). These must be tax years.

**Example**

You’ll reach State Pension age on 6 March 2018. This is in the tax year 6 April 2017 to 5 April 2018.

You got married in 1975 and chose to to pay National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate.

Your State Pension will be worked out differently if your reduced rate election still applied to you in 1982.

##What you may get if you have a reduced rate election

You’ll get a State Pension that will be about the same as:

- the lower rate basic State Pension of £67.8 a week (if married or in a civil partnership and your partner has reached State Pension age)
- the rate of the basic State Pension of £113.1 a week (if widowed, divorced or your civil partnership has been dissolved)

You’ll also get any Additional State Pension that you built up before 6 April 2016 on top of this basic amount.

This will be paid to you when:

- you or your spouse or civil partner reach State Pension age (whichever is later)
- you reach State Pension age (if widowed or divorced)
- you’re widowed, divorced or your civil partnership has been dissolved after you reach State Pension age

^You won’t need to have the minimum of 10 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get a State Pension if you’re eligible under these different rules.^

You’ll get more if your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.

##If you become widowed

You might be able to inherit part of your spouse or civil partner’s Additional State Pension or Protected Payment if you become widowed. You must have been married or in a civil partnership with your partner before 6 April 2016.

^What you might be able to inherit depends on when your spouse or civil partner reached or would have reached State Pension age.^

If your spouse or civil partner reached State Pension age or died under State Pension age before 6 April 2016 you may be able to inherit a portion of their [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension/further-information).

This will also be based on your late spouse or civil partner’s contributions to their Additional State Pension up to 6 April 2016.

If your spouse or civil partner reached State Pension age or died under State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016 you may be able to inherit a portion of their [Protected Payment](/new-state-pension/inheriting-or-increasing-state-pension-from-a-spouse-or-civil-partner).

^You won’t be able to inherit either your late spouse or civil partner’s Additional State Pension or Protected Payment if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before State Pension age.^

##Other help if you’re widowed

You might be eligible for the following if you haven’t yet reached State Pension age:

- [Widowed Parent’s Allowance](/widowed-parents-allowance)
- a [Bereavement payment](/bereavement-payment)
- [Bereavement Allowance](/bereavement-allowance)

You should contact the [future pension centre](/future-pension-centre) if you become widowed.

##Increase your retirement income

You might be able to increase your State Pension amount if:

- you’re eligible for [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits)
- you make [voluntary National Insurance contributions](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions)
- you choose to defer your State Pension

You can also contribute to [workplace pension](/workplace-pensions) and [personal or private pensions](/personal-pensions-your-rights).
