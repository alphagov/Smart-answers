You can’t claim ESA. If you were receiving [Incapacity Benefit](/incapacity-benefit) while living in Guernsey, you may be asked to transition from Incapacity Benefit to ESA (contributory).

You may also be able to get benefits from Guernsey if you’ve paid into a local social security insurance scheme. Contact the local authorities to find out more.
