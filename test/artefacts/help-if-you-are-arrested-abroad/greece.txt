<h2 id="what-the-fco-and-british-consulate-cant-do">What the FCO and British consulate can’t do</h2>

<p>The FCO and British consulate won’t be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get someone out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>help someone get special treatment</li>
  <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>pay for any costs as a result of being arrested</li>
  <li>forward packages sent by friends or family to an arrested person or prisoner</li>
  <li>prevent authorities from deporting a British national after release</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dual-nationals">Dual nationals</h2>

<p>The FCO and British consulate can help a dual British national (with a valid British passport) as long as they’re arrested in a country other than the one they hold dual nationality with.</p>

<p>They won’t get involved if someone’s arrested in a country for which they hold a valid passport, unless there’s a special humanitarian reason to do so.</p>
